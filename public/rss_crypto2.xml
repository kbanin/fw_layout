<![CDATA[ <p><a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/el-salvador-bitcoin-news">El Salvador</a> made history in 2021 by becoming the first country to adopt Bitcoin as a legal tender under the leadership of <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/tags/nayib-bukele">President Nayib Bukele</a>.

<![CDATA[ <p>JPMorgan Chase, the largest bank in America, has <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/19617/000001961724000369/0000019617-24-000369.txt">revealed</a> exposure to spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) in a newly filed document with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) today.</p><figure> <a href="https://x.com/PhoenixTrades_/status/1789018590206669258" ><img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA2MzQyNjU5NjA5NDA1MTM0/download-42.png" height="342" width="1200"></a> <figcaption><p><a href="https://x.com/PhoenixTrades_/status/1789018590206669258">Phoenix Trades</a></p></figcaption> </figure> <p>The SEC filing by JPMorgan Chase provides specific insights into the bank's exposure to spot Bitcoin ETFs. The bank currently has exposure to spot Bitcoin ETFs issued by some of the largest asset managers in the world: BlackRock, Fidelity, Grayscale, and more.</p><p>Though, the amount of money allocated to each ETF seems a bit underwhelming, taking into consideration how much money other institutions are allocating to purchasing Bitcoin. That's because:</p><p>"JPM, Susquehanna (which also owns these ETFs and was all over this site last week) and others are just market makers and/or AP's. Their ownership isn't necessarily indicative of anything other than this is how many shares they had on 3/31/24," <a href="https://x.com/JSeyff/status/1789026505013506157">commented</a> Bloomberg ETF Analyst James Seyffart. "If you're making markets in these things, the number of shares held could swing heavily day to day. The 13F data is simply a snapshot of *LONG* positions held on 3/31 13F's don't show shorts OR derivatives. So we don't even have a full look at their true exposure on 3/31."</p><p>Bloomberg Senior ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas also commented on the news, <a href="https://x.com/EricBalchunas/status/1789026897852047366">stating</a> we'll "prob[ably] see many of the big banks report some holdings in their role as market makers/APs. That is dif[ferent from] them buying for the exposure (and thus less hypocritical in JPM's case).. props for catching this tho we still working on getting the file on bbg it just came out."</p><p>"What is notable IMO is the sheer number of holders that each has so far. $IBIT is up to 250. That's bonkers for first quarter on market," Balchunas <a href="https://x.com/EricBalchunas/status/1789027843449512147">continued</a>. "Here's comparison of the other ETFs launched same week-ish as btc ones. And we still have like a week of 13Fs to roll in yet."</p><figure> <a href="https://x.com/EricBalchunas/status/1789027843449512147" ><img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA2MzQzMjI5MjI4OTg0MDE0/gnpnjmgxaaeenql.png" height="800" width="1065"></a> <figcaption><p><a href="https://x.com/EricBalchunas/status/1789027843449512147">Eric Balchunas</a></p></figcaption> </figure> <p>JPMorgan's disclosure comes just hours after Wells Fargo, America's third largest bank, also made a similar <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/wells-fargo-americas-third-largest-bank-owns-spot-bitcoin-etfs-sec-filing">revelation</a> about its spot Bitcoin ETF exposure.</p><figure> <a href="https://bm.b.tc/unchained-bmag-dot-com" ><img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA2MzM4Njk1MDg1Njk2NzE4/unnamed-40.png" height="506" width="1200"></a> <figcaption><em>Click the image to learn more.</em></figcaption> </figure> ]]>

<![CDATA[ <p><strong><em>The below is an excerpt from a recent edition of Bitcoin Magazine Pro, Bitcoin Magazine's premium markets newsletter. To be among the first to receive these insights and other on-chain bitcoin market analysis straight to your inbox, </em></strong><strong><em><a href="https://bmpro.substack.com/">subscribe now</a>.</em></strong></p><figure> <a href="https://bmpro.substack.com/" ><img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjAxMjU3OTE4Njk0MTcyMTYx/mtg5njayntyzmtmymjm2ode4.jpg" height="246" width="1200"></a> </figure> <p>Modern Monetary Theory (MMT) is back in the spotlight, driven by a new film <em><a href="https://findingmoneyfilm.com/">Finding the Money</a></em> and a <a href="https://x.com/FindingMoneyDoc/status/1786050601236779078">recent clip</a> that went viral on Bitcoin Twitter and Fintwit. In the clip, Jared Bernstein, Chair of the Council of Economic Advisors to the US President, is seen not being able to describe the most basic concepts of government debt and money printing. He claims MMT is correct but some of the language and concepts (the most basic ones) are confusing to him. An absolutely shocking statement given his role. </p><p>In this post, I will outline several major flaws in MMT that perhaps you, dear reader, will be able to use to go forth and debunk MMT. The stakes are high, because MMT cultists are gaining positions of power in governments around the world, as exemplified by Mr. Bernstein. It is a very dangerous proposition to put these people in power, because they will rapidly destroy the currency and cause economic armageddon. As bitcoiners, we believe bitcoin will replace the credit-based dollar, but we want the transition to be natural and relatively uneventful. A collapse of a major currency without bitcoin being ready to take the reins, would be catastrophic for so many. </p><h2>Introduction to MMT</h2><p>Modern Monetary Theory (MMT) is a post-Keynesian macroeconomic framework asserting that fiscal deficits are essentially inconsequential, monetary policy should be subordinate to fiscal policy, and monetary authorities ought to issue base money to finance massive government programs. MMT promises to eliminate involuntary unemployment and address social issues such as poverty and climate change. MMT is rooted in the belief that all money is a creation of the State, engineered through legal frameworks to facilitate governmental control over economic activities.</p><p>According to MMT, the government, which can issue its currency at will, cannot go bankrupt. However, there are obvious limitations to this power, like the inability to control the currency's value. MMT also redefines the traditional functions of money—medium of exchange, store of value, and unit of account—asserting that these functions are mere byproducts of government policy rather than intrinsic properties like scarcity and divisibility. This theory leads to the controversial notion that a government could dictate any item as money—be it acorns, IOUs, or Bitcoin—solely based on legal declarations, disregarding their properties, a concept starkly at odds with real-world economic dynamics.</p><h2>No Coherent Theory of Value</h2><p>The most significant shortcomings of Modern Monetary Theory is its approach to the theory of value. Instead of a subjective theory of value, where prices emerge through the preferences of individual actors, like personal spending or saving decisions, MMT replaces this with a democratic or collective theory of value.</p><p>According to MMT, the value of money is not derived from its utility in monetary functions—such as a medium of exchange, a store of value, or a unit of account. Instead, in MMT money's value originates from the collective acceptance and trust in the state that issues it. This acceptance then supposedly confers value onto the money. In other words, MMT reverses the traditional understanding: it is not that something valuable becomes accepted as money, but that something becomes valuable because of forced acceptance as money.</p><p>The value of money is reliant on the State being the economic calculator of sorts, instead of the individual market actors. The aggregate preferences of society along with central planning expertise go into an equation and full-employment is the result. This is not a joke. They don't have a theory of value beyond what was just explained.</p><h2>The Mechanics of MMT: Taxes and Fiscal Policy</h2><p>Modern Monetary Theory presents a skewed understanding of fiscal policy and taxation, proposing that taxes serve as the base load of demand for state-issued money. Without taxes, MMT adherents argue, government spending would lead to devaluation. This point reveals a notable contradiction: while MMT devotees fervently deny that deficits matter at all, they simultaneously argue that taxes are essential to counteract deficits’ adverse effects.</p><figure> <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA2MzM2OTgxNjYyMTgxMDcw/f9f9c23a-017e-4323-b590-378bdd98a032_1527x786.jpg" height="617" width="1200"> <figcaption><em>Source: <a href="https://www.marketplace.org/2019/01/24/modern-monetary-theory-explained/">MarketPlace</a></em></figcaption> </figure> <p>Furthermore, MMT believers overlook broader dynamics in currency markets. Taxes alone do not necessarily promote demand to hold a currency. Individuals may choose to minimize their holdings due to fears of depreciation, only converting other assets into cash when necessary to fulfill tax obligations. For example, a person might primarily operate using an alternative currency and only acquire the domestic currency in amounts needed to pay taxes.</p><p>In terms of fiscal policy, MMT contends the primary constraints on money printing are inflation, which in turn is due to the availability of real resources, such as labor and capital. In their school of thought, if they print money the result is economic growth until labor and capital are fully employed. Raising taxes is the mechanism to fight inflation by taking money out of the economy.</p><p>Another significant flaw in MMT is its required belief that the State can precisely manage fiscal policy outcomes. MMT overlooks the inherent limitations of central planning, particularly the circular reasoning that the information guiding fiscal policy is merely a reflection of previous government actions, assuming perfect policy transmission, without appreciation for real market data or external market dynamics. <strong>Are MMT planners in control or not? If so, it’s circular. If not, it’s wrong.</strong> </p><p>MMT does not acknowledge the existence of unintended consequences that necessitate frequent policy adjustments and undermine demand for the currency, because that would mean they aren’t in control. Moreover, market interest rates further complicate matters for MMT devotees. Micromanaging the economy would result in drastic declines in economic activity, lower demand for the currency and higher interest rates. Consequently, while MMT claims that the State can mandate the use of its currency, it does not have the power to control how the market values or trusts that currency.</p><h2>MMT and Resource Allocation</h2><p>MMT's approach to resource allocation emphasizes achieving "full employment" through top-down fiscal policies without addressing the efficiency of labor and capital use. Proponents of MMT argue that with the right fiscal policies, full employment of labor, capital, and resources can be guaranteed. However, they struggle to justify, using MMT principles, why seemingly unproductive activities like digging holes and then filling them back in are less beneficial than market derived employment of labor and capital. This often leads to ambiguous explanations about the differences in output, without a clear, consistent standard of value.</p><p>According to MMT, all economic activities that consume equal resources must be perceived as equally valuable, blurring the lines between productive investments and wasteful expenditures. For instance, there is no fundamental distinction made between using resources to build essential infrastructure or to construct "bridges to nowhere." This lack of an understanding of value leads to policies where the primary goal is employment rather than the value created by employment. The result is massive misallocation of labor and capital. </p><h2>Conclusion and Implications</h2><p>Modern Monetary Theory’s foundational principles and policy implications contain critical flaws. These range from its incoherent theory of value and reliance on circular fiscal policy logic, to its failure in competitive international currency markets and unworkable resource allocation strategies. Each of these risks could have profound consequences if MMT were widely implemented.</p><p>For those paying attention in the Bitcoin space, the similarities between MMT and Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) are particularly striking. CBDCs represent a shift from our current credit-based monetary system to a new form of fiat that can be tightly controlled through programmable policies—mirroring MMT's advocacy for pure fiat money managed by detailed fiscal policies. This alignment suggests that regions like Europe and China, which are advancing in CBDC implementation, may naturally gravitate towards MMT principles.</p><p><a href="https://substack.com/app/app-store-redirect?utm_campaign=app-marketing&utm_content=author-post-insert&utm_source=bmpro"></a></p><p>These transitions are monumental. A major economy cannot instantaneously switch to a new form of fiat money, despite what the MMT cultists would like you to think. The transition will span years, during which we'll likely witness the decline of traditional currencies. As MMT and these governments inadvertently champion Bitcoin, the choice for individuals, capital, and innovators will become clear. If people are forced to adopt a whole new form of money anyway, it will be a simple choice for capital, economic activity, and innovation to flee into Bitcoin.</p> ]]>

But what happens when you need to travel? If you hold large amounts of bitcoin in cold storage, should you carry the keys to your bitcoin wallet with you? And if you do travel with one or more keys, what steps do you need to take to stay secure?</p><p>Consider these seven tips for traveling with your bitcoin in a way that keeps you in control while minimizing risk.</p><h2>1. Carry only the wallets you need</h2><p>Bitcoin allows you to segregate funds into multiple wallets so you only need to carry the keys you need for smaller amounts of bitcoin. You can secure your bitcoin savings in cold storage multisig, while still carrying some sats in a hot wallet on your phone like <a href="https://bluewallet.io/">BlueWallet</a> or <a href="https://muun.com/">Muun</a>.</p><p>By only carrying keys to the wallets you need, you can spend and receive bitcoin while leaving the majority of your savings in a secure cold storage setup, such as multisig, that eliminates single points of failure.</p><figure> <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA2MzIwNjczMTM0NDg2ODY4/mobile-wallet_image-prev2.png" height="673" width="1200"> </figure> <h2>2. Consider your destination</h2><p>Consider your destination and travel plans when evaluating the risks of traveling with your bitcoin keys. What is the relative crime risk at your destination? Is your destination a high-crime nation or city? What will your surroundings be like?</p><p>If your destination has higher crime rates or pervasive petty theft, assume your phone will be stolen. Keep good smartphone security, and avoid holding keys to significant amounts of bitcoin on that device. Minimizing potential bitcoin losses by only keeping small amounts in mobile wallets is one consideration, but even storing keys to multisig wallets on your smartphone when traveling can increase the chances of compromise, necessitating <a href="https://unchained.com/blog/replace-key-multisig-wallet/?utm_campaign=btcmag-launch">an arduous key replacement</a>.</p><figure> <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA2MzIwNjczNDAyOTIyMzI0/bitcoin_events_header-prev1.png" height="674" width="1200"> </figure> <p>If you’re traveling to an event where ownership of bitcoin is assumed, adjust your security model around the assumption that everyone knows you own bitcoin. That could mean ensuring that any singlesig wallets have a passphrase, or securing smaller amounts of bitcoin with multisig and distributing the keys in your belongings while traveling.</p><h2>3. Avoid traveling with seed phrase backups</h2><p>You should <a href="https://unchained.com/blog/why-you-should-always-secure-your-seed-phrase-four-unexpected-errors/?utm_campaign=btcmag-launch">always secure your seed phrases</a>, but remember that they are the unencrypted secret for a given key, making them much easier to compromise than a hardware wallet. While your hardware wallet’s private key data is generally secured within a <a href="https://unchained.com/blog/bitcoin-what-is-a-secure-element/?utm_campaign=btcmag-launch">secure element</a>, behind a PIN, and requires a PC to access, seed phrase backups are easier to physically steal, copy, or photograph.</p><p>For most normal travel, you should leave your seed phrase backups in a secure storage location and travel with one or more hardware wallets.</p><figure> <a href="https://unchained.com/pricing/?utm_campaign=btcmag-launch" ><img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA2MjQ5NDY3Njc2OTkyNjg4/btcmag100_100_off_promo_1200x300-1.jpg" height="300" width="1200"></a> <figcaption><em>Visit </em><em><a href="https://unchained.com/pricing/?utm_campaign=btcmag-launch">Unchained.com</a></em><em> for $100 off any Unchained financial services product with code “</em><em><a href="https://unchained.com/pricing/?utm_campaign=btcmag-launch">BTCMAG100</a></em><em>”</em></figcaption> </figure> <h3>If you must travel with a seed phrase backup</h3><p>You might need to travel with a <a href="https://unchained.com/blog/what-is-a-bitcoin-seed-phrase/?utm_campaign=btcmag-launch">seed phrase backup</a> in some situations. Moving permanent physical residences (we <a href="https://unchained.com/blog/how-to-move-house-multisig/?utm_campaign=btcmag-launch">published a guide</a> that you should read if this is your situation) and traveling to set up a safely-stored key item in a multisig setup are both reasonable reasons to be traveling with your 12- or 24-word seed phrase.</p><figure> <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA2MzIwNjczNDAyOTg4MjM4/hot-wallet-guy-prev1.png" height="670" width="1200"> </figure> <p>If you must travel with a seed phrase, there are things you can do to minimize the chance of exposure and retain peace of mind:</p><ul><li><strong>Remain inconspicuous in airport security</strong>: Put a paper seed phrase backup inside a book, or split up a seed phrase by writing it in a physical notebook using some convention that you will remember. Avoid using suspicious metal locks or cases. If your bag gets pulled for suspicion, there’s a much greater chance your seed phrase will be seen.</li><li><strong>Use a passphrase for singlesig wallets</strong>: PINs can protect a hardware wallet, but a passphrase will protect your seed phrase! While passphrases are <a href="https://unchained.com/blog/bitcoin-singlesig-passphrase-vs-multisig/?utm_campaign=btcmag-launch">generally risky compared to other custody setups like multisig</a>, it can make sense to use one with a singlesig wallet while traveling with a seed phrase as long as it’s properly backed up (don’t rely on your memory!).</li><li><strong>Take advantage of traveling companions</strong>: Consider a multisig wallet (see below), give a travel companion one seed phrase, keep one seed phrase on your person, and store one seed phrase on a hardware wallet in a checked bag, for example. If you absolutely must ensure that one seed phrase is already at your destination, you can compromise one by storing it temporarily in a password manager prior to leaving (see below).</li></ul><h2>4. Watch what you say and show</h2><p>Before an attacker can attack, they need to know who they’re going after. This is where operational security comes in. Much of this advice applies to saving wealth with bitcoin in general, but it’s especially applicable while traveling.</p><figure> <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA2MzIwNjczNDAyOTIyNzAy/bitcoin_ninja-prev2.png" height="672" width="1200"> </figure> <p>On the go, you’re often at the whims of people and environments you can’t control. These are riskier situations to make it publicly known that you might hold substantial amounts of bitcoin.</p><ul><li><strong>Don’t talk about bitcoin with people you don’t trust</strong>: One of the easiest things you can do is simply talk about bitcoin less! Be cautious when “spreading the word.”</li><li><strong>Don’t put bitcoin stickers on your laptop or devices</strong>: These are like big neon signs that say, “this device is storing private key data!”</li><li><strong>Don’t wear bitcoin-related merchandise</strong>: Especially in places where people know what to look for, wearing merchandise or clothing with bitcoin logos unnecessarily puts a target on your back.</li><li><strong>Don’t talk about how much bitcoin you own</strong>: It’s generally a good idea to only share the amount of bitcoin you hold on a need-to-know basis. Knowing you’re a higher-value target might make an attacker consider more extreme or risky actions.</li></ul><p>Notably, these behaviors can create physical risk when traveling even if you don’t have any private key data on your person. If someone tries to attack you with a $5 wrench and you don’t have any bitcoin to give them, your bitcoin might survive, but your kneecaps might not!</p><h2>5. Create a decoy wallet</h2><p>Whether you’re traveling with a hardware wallet or software wallet, many wallets allow you to make a decoy wallet. Decoy wallets allow you to create a second wallet, entirely separate from your primary one, that you can activate in duress scenarios. With these, you typically add funds you’re willing to lose but significant enough to make the attacker think they got what they wanted.</p><figure> <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA2MzIwNjczMTM0NTUyNDA0/coldard_hardware_wallet_wearing_a_disguise-prev1.png" height="670" width="1200"> </figure> <p>There are a few different ways to set up a decoy bitcoin wallet:</p><ol><li>Singlesig + passphrase</li><li>Use one key in a multisig quorum</li><li>Duress PIN</li></ol><h3>Singlesig + passphrase</h3><p>With a passphrase, you can set up a secondary wallet that would give an attacker access to a small subset of your funds. You could also make the primary wallet a decoy while using a passphrase for your main wallet. Always <a href="https://unchained.com/blog/bitcoin-singlesig-passphrase-vs-multisig/?utm_campaign=btcmag-launch">consider the tradeoffs of using a passphrase</a>, however, and always ensure you have your passphrase properly backed up (it’s case-sensitive).</p><h3>Multisig</h3><p>If you use multisig, as long as you can keep it a secret that any given hardware wallet or seed phrase is part of a multisig setup, you can protect yourself by using one of the keys in the quorum as a decoy. To do this, simply use one hardware or software wallet normally part of your multisig setup as a standalone wallet. An attacker could access the funds sent to the singlesig wallet associated with that seed while not accessing—or even knowing about—the wallet constructed with multisig.</p><h3>Duress PIN</h3><p>Some wallet makers allow you to set up a duress PIN. With this functionality, you can set up a second PIN that gives an attacker access to a second decoy wallet. If you’re attacked, give the attacker the wrong PIN and let them have the smaller subset of funds in that wallet.</p><p>As an example, the Coldcard hardware wallet offers three types of duress PINs: one that unlocks a decoy wallet, one that destroys the seed upon entry, and one that creates a countdown to customizable “brick modes”. These tools offer you confidence that attackers won’t be able to access your primary bitcoin keys—if any at all.</p><h2>6. Consider multisig to eliminate single points of failure</h2><p>Bitcoin’s native multisig feature can help create decoy wallets, but it’s also a powerful tool for mitigating travel risk generally. Perhaps you need to travel with private keys, but want to avoid the single point of failure of singlesig wallets. Traveling with three hardware wallets, each key held as one in a multisig quorum, can help reduce your risk.</p><figure> <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA2MzIwNjczMTM0NTUyNzgy/221012_security_best_practices_header_1920x1080px.png" height="675" width="1200"> </figure> <p>There are many unique capabilities that multisig opens for you if you’re traveling. Each of the following have security implications and trade-offs to consider beyond the scope of this article, but you could:</p><ul><li><strong>Distribute held keys while traveling</strong>: You can travel on a plane with a 2-of-3 multisig where one key is on your person, another key is in a secret compartment in your carry-on luggage, with a third key and seed phrase backups geographically distributed in other secure locations. This keeps three keys separated, requiring two of the three to come together to spend funds.</li><li><strong>Digitally store a seed phrase</strong>: Temporarily compromising a seed phrase by storing it in a password manager ensures that at least one seed phrase backup to your multisig quorum is already at your destination. When you arrive at the destination, you can <a href="https://unchained.com/blog/replace-key-multisig-wallet/?utm_campaign=btcmag-launch">conduct a key replacement</a> for any seed phrase temporarily stored on an internet-connected device.</li><li><strong>Mail yourself a hardware wallet or seed phrase</strong>: If you’re traveling with substantial bitcoin funds and you don’t want to expose yourself to theft from physical attacks in a 2-of-3 multisig while traveling, for example, you can mail one hardware wallet or seed phrase your destination, carry one key on your person, and then still be able to spend funds when you arrive.</li><li><strong>Partner countersigns</strong>: A custody partner, whether that be a financial institution like Unchained or trusted third-party, can coordinate with you to sign transactions while traveling if you want to travel with a minority of keys in multisig.</li></ul><p>You can use a tool like <a href="https://sparrowwallet.com/">Sparrow</a>, <a href="https://electrum.org/#home">Electrum</a>, or <a href="https://unchained-capital.github.io/caravan/#/?utm_campaign=btcmag-launch">our very own Caravan</a> to construct multisig wallets yourself, and if you need help setting up multisig or understanding travel best practices in the context of collaborative custody, <a href="https://unchained.com/concierge/?utm_campaign=btcmag-launch">we have a team</a> that can help you with that.</p><h2>7. Have an inheritance plan</h2><p>It’s a good idea for anyone with substantive bitcoin wealth to have an inheritance plan, but that’s especially the case when traveling. If something were to happen to you while traveling, you want peace of mind knowing that your bitcoin will be rightfully passed to your next of kin without a hitch.</p><figure> <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA2MzIwNjczMTM0NDg3MjQ2/inheritance-protocol-prev1.png" height="673" width="1200"> </figure> <p>This would be very difficult if traveling with your self-custody bitcoin in a singlesig wallet, but multisig—and even better for inheritance purposes, including a collaborative custody partner in your multisig setup—can give you the best of all worlds: convenient access to your self-custody bitcoin and peace of mind knowing it will be taken care of in your absence.</p><p>We previously wrote an article explaining the intricacies of <a href="https://unchained.com/blog/how-to-inheritance-plan-unchained-vault/?utm_campaign=btcmag-launch">how to set up an inheritance plan for your bitcoin</a> if that’s something you want to consider before traveling.</p><figure> <a href="https://unchained.com/pricing/?utm_campaign=btcmag-launch" ><img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA2MjQ5NDY3Njc2OTkyNjg4/btcmag100_100_off_promo_1200x300-1.jpg" height="300" width="1200"></a> <figcaption><em>Visit </em><em><a href="https://unchained.com/pricing/?utm_campaign=btcmag-launch">Unchained.com</a></em><em> for $100 off any Unchained financial services product with code “</em><em><a href="https://unchained.com/pricing/?utm_campaign=btcmag-launch">BTCMAG100</a></em><em>”</em></figcaption> </figure> <h2>More bitcoin security considerations</h2><p>Traveling procedures are important, but there’s so much more to bitcoin key security.

<![CDATA[ <p><em>Originally posted on <a href="https://medium.com/breez-technology/orange-pilling-has-stopped-working-4a407252c7a3">Medium</a>.</em></p><p>In the context of bitcoin, “<a href="https://slate.com/technology/2022/05/bitcoin-and-crypto-crash-a-guide-for-normies.html">normie</a>” means something like “don’t know, don’t care.” And “normie” comes from “normal.” In other words, normal people don’t care about bitcoin, at least not enough to use it.</p><p>Lack of exposure is not the problem. Bitcoin now regularly appears in the headlines of mainstream media, like <a href="https://eu.usatoday.com/story/money/investing/2024/04/21/is-bitcoin-a-millionaire-maker/73380530007/">USAToday</a>, <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/bitcoin-holds-steady-after-completing-fourth-ever-halving/ar-AA1noAlf">Fox</a>, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/advisor/in/investing/cryptocurrency/bitcoin-halving-2024/">Forbes</a>, <a href="https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2024/03/06/bitcoins-price-is-surging-what-happens-next">The Economist</a>, <a href="https://www.lemonde.fr/pixels/article/2024/03/05/le-bitcoin-atteint-un-niveau-jamais-atteint-a-plus-de-69-000-dollars_6220260_4408996.html">Le Monde</a>, you name it. The term <em>bitcoin</em> generates more search traffic than other terms most of us are sick of hearing, like <em>kardashian</em><em>.</em></p><figure> <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA2MzEzOTg0NTI4MjI5NTUy/kardashian.jpg" height="701" width="1200"> <figcaption><em>Search results for "bitcoin" and "kardashian"</em></figcaption> </figure> <p>But even though virtually every human and most seagulls have heard of bitcoin, <a href="https://buybitcoinworldwide.com/how-many-bitcoin-users/">fewer than half a million</a> use it daily.</p><p>And it’s not for lack of effort on the part of the bitcoin community. We’ve written <a href="https://www.amazon.com/bitcoin-Books/s?k=bitcoin&rh=n%3A283155">books</a>, blogs (so many blogs!), recorded <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=bitcoin">videos</a>, organized conferences and meetups, and hosted podcasts (so many podcasts!) preaching the value of bitcoin. We put more effort into converting the nocoin infidels than most religions, but our beautiful temple remains sadly empty.</p><p>Educating the world about bitcoin has succeeded in building a community of knowledgeable, dedicated, enthusiastic people from the fields of tech, economics, politics, and finance, but orange pilling has taken us as far as it can. Like many strategies, the marginal gains of educating the world were remarkable in the early stages, but they’ve flattened.</p><p>Orange pilling has stopped working.</p><h2>Show, Don't Tell</h2><p>I realize how controversial this claim is because orange pilling is so popular. It’s a strategy that has served us really well over the past 15 years. And most bitcoiners like education. We tend to be critical thinkers who devour blogs and books and podcasts to learn more about our passion and keep our minds sharp.</p><p>But we don’t research <em>every topic</em>, nor do we have to. I know very little about what a good workout and eating healthy do to my body on a cellular level, but I feel the benefits of both. In fact, our world is so complex that nobody can really understand all the important facets. How many welders and virologists or aeronautical engineers and app developers really understand each others’ fields? Most people are ignorant about most useful topics, and that’s just the way it is in a highly complex world.</p><p>Expertise, however, is not a precondition of enjoyment. I use all kinds of products and technologies — TikTok, AI assistants, and even water-treatment plants — simply because they make my life better. That’s all I really need to know. No technical understanding required.</p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/y5QbrRRMg20" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><p>All you need to benefit from a technology is utility. It just has to improve people’s lives somehow, whether they understand it at a granular level or not. We can tell people about bitcoin’s benefits until we’re exhausted and they’re annoyed. What matters is how they actually experience it. We should stop telling them how great the bitcoin economy is going to be and start showing them. Less theory, more practice.</p><p>Think of remote work. In the 1970s, big companies like IBM were merely toying with the idea, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_work#History">experimenting with a few workers</a> at a time. Then technology happened: broadband & WiFi, corporate VPNs, cloud storage, cheap and powerful computers for pockets and desks. And don’t forget all the software: Zoom, Teams, Slack, Meet, SharePoint, etc.</p><p>But even just a decade ago, remote work was something many had heard of, but few had tried. It was growing at just a few percent per year. Enter COVID. Rates doubled, then tripled. Now <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1450450/employees-remote-work-share/">67% of us techies</a> work mostly or entirely from home.</p><p>Yes, COVID was a shock, but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_epidemics_and_pandemics">pandemics are nothing new</a>. The last one revolutionized the geography of work because of the tech. The technology had become really useful, and the pandemic just gave us the occasion to realize it. Would the revolution in remote work have happened eventually without the pandemic? Almost certainly, if not as fast. Would it have happened eventually without the technology? The question doesn’t even make sense because the technology defines how we even think about “remote work.”</p><p>Useful technology changes behavior, habits, and society. Sometimes radically.</p><p>We bitcoiners need to learn, internalize, and remember this lesson. <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/important-to-teach-people-about-bitcoin">The orange pills</a> have stopped working, at least at our current scale. Experiences are what change people’s minds, and we build those experiences with technology, not conferences. As soon as we start delivering experiences that surpass anything fiat can do, people will adopt bitcoin automatically. Until we start delivering such services, no amount of books and blogs will change their minds or habits.</p><figure> <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA2MzEzOTY4NDIyMTAyMTky/orange_pill.jpg" height="800" width="1200"> <figcaption><em>Orange pills were once medicine; now they're just candy. (Image: </em><a href="https://www.publicdomainpictures.net/en/view-image.php?image=168807&amp;picture=medication">George Hodan</a><em>)</em></figcaption> </figure> <h2>Where to Start</h2><p>So if the key is to improve people’s lives, whose lives are we talking about? There’s a big difference between <a href="https://medium.com/breez-technology/the-breez-release-candidate-getting-lightning-ready-for-the-global-takeover-b5d1f9756229">a corner store in Hyderabad</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/breez-technology/lightning-in-the-wild-victoria-kayak-9119e863b87b">outdoorsy Canadians</a>. Different interests, different needs.</p><p>Think about the revolutionary technologies of recent decades: the television, the PC, the internet, the smartphone, Facebook, <em>AI</em>. They all took root in the same demographic: people with disposable income in developed countries. Facebook took this approach to the extreme by first opening <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Facebook">only to students attending elite Western universities</a>. And now it’s your aunt’s favorite technology. Another lesson.</p><p>So the way forward is to leverage bitcoin’s strengths as a borderless, open, censorship resistant, and — most importantly — P2P currency in order to improve the lives of affluent people with money to spend. Give them better ways to transact directly with each other.</p><p>In practice, this will often mean <a href="https://medium.com/breez-technology/we-need-more-apps-with-lightning-not-more-lightning-apps-b5f37f9ac8bd">adding bitcoin to apps they use anyway</a>. It might also mean disintermediating services they’re already using. Like connecting gig drivers to passengers directly without Uber taking its cut. Like connecting artists directly to fans without Spotify and the record companies taking their cut. Like paying Dashers directly without DoorDash taking its cut.</p><p>The winning formula is to insert our tech into an existing, suboptimal user experience, just like the <a href="https://medium.com/breez-technology/we-need-more-apps-with-lightning-not-more-lightning-apps-b5f37f9ac8bd">iPhone did with the digital camera</a>. Utility improves the UX, and the UX drives adoption. <a href="https://quoteinvestigator.com/2019/01/13/margin/">The incumbents’ margin is our opportunity</a>. This is the essence of disruption.</p><p>Let me also clarify that better gadgets for affluent Westerners are not more important than giving people in developing countries access to modern financial services and shelter from their governments’ corruption. That’s vital too. It’s just that affluent Westerners are a more effective way to move the market and propagate the technology. They’re the gateway drug, the beachhead to mainstream adoption. But yes, changing the whole world and improving the lives of everyone in it with bitcoin remains the ultimate goal.</p><h2>Utility > Education</h2><p>Education is important for people who need the inside-baseball-level information — entrepreneurs, engineers, investors, etc. It’s usually easier to improve a thing if you understand how it works than through random trial and error.</p><p>To just use a thing, though, all you need to know is how, not why. <a href="https://books.google.de/books?hl=en&lr=&id=Dx7slq__udwC&oi=fnd&pg=PT1&ots=Wf6LgYD3DQ&sig=rev8wMoq3t6gFscbjrAMcd_W8gQ&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false">Dozens of animal species</a> use tools to make their lives better. A few of them might have a vague idea of the tools’ operating principles — thick stick = strong and rigid; thin stick = light and flexible — and that’s enough. All of us use countless technologies already without understanding them, simply because we like the experience.</p><p>We don’t really have to conduct much research about how to improve people’s experiences with bitcoin. It’s easy to find <a href="https://www.visualcapitalist.com/cp/most-popular-apps-by-downloads/">which apps are most popular</a>. Many, if not most, if not all of them could be improved with borderless P2P payments, right? That’s the whole idea, right? So let’s add our borderless P2P payments to them or rebuild them with our tech. If we do it right, and bitcoin really is better (which of course it is), then we won’t have to convince people anymore. They’ll just adopt it and convince each other.</p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ <p>The Executive Office of US President Joe Biden has <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/SAP-HJRes109.pdf">announced</a> its stance on proposed legislation, H.J. Res. 109, that would allow highly regulated financial firms to act as custodians for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. </p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">JUST IN: 🇺🇸 US President Joe Biden Administration says Biden would veto legislation that would allow highly regulated financial firms to custody <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bitcoin?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Bitcoin</a> and crypto. <a href="https://t.co/aXx8aq1m0Z">pic.twitter.com/aXx8aq1m0Z</a></p>&mdash; Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) <a href="https://twitter.com/BitcoinMagazine/status/1788274505753755836?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 8, 2024</a></blockquote> <script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> <p>"The Administration strongly opposes passage of H.J. Res. 109, which would disrupt the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) work to protect investors in crypto-asset markets and to safeguard the broader financial system," The Executive Office of The President stated. "If the President were presented with H.J. Res. 109, he would veto it."</p><p>H.J.Res. 109 would overturn the SEC’s Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 121, which imposes restrictions on financial institutions regarding the custody of digital assets, under the Congressional Review Act (CRA). By overturning SAB 121, this bipartisan resolution would remove roadblocks that prevent highly regulated financial institutions and firms from acting as custodians for Bitcoin and digital assets.</p><p>US Congressman Patrick McHenry, Chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, <a href="https://financialservices.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=409247">expressed support</a> for overturning the SEC's SAB 121, stating, “Staff Accounting Bulletin, or SAB, 121 is one of the most glaring examples of the regulatory overreach that has defined Gary Gensler’s tenure at the SEC. Through SAB 121, the Commission is trying to dictate how financial institutions and firms safeguard Americans’ digital assets under the guise of so-called staff guidance.”</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/WATCH?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#WATCH</a>: Chairman <a href="https://twitter.com/PatrickMcHenry?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@PatrickMcHenry</a> delivers remarks in support of H.J.Res. 109 to nullify SAB 121:<br><br>&quot;This bipartisan resolution is an essential effort to protect consumers and foster innovation in digital asset markets.&quot;<br><br>Read more 🔗<a href="https://t.co/jnIBJFHIPj">https://t.co/jnIBJFHIPj</a><br><br>📺 Watch 👇 <a href="https://t.co/fOxOh8DtWH">pic.twitter.com/fOxOh8DtWH</a></p>&mdash; Financial Services GOP (@FinancialCmte) <a href="https://twitter.com/FinancialCmte/status/1788250258885038239?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 8, 2024</a></blockquote> <script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> <p>“SAB 121 requires financial institutions and firms that are safeguarding their customers’ digital assets to hold those assets on their balance sheet," McHenry continued. “That means banks would be required to take on significant capital, liquidity, and other costs under the existing prudential regulatory framework. This essentially makes it cost prohibitive for financial institutions to custody their customers’ digital assets. This is a massive deviation from how highly regulated banks are traditionally required to treat the assets they hold on behalf of their customers.”<em> </em></p><p>US Congressman French Hill also spoke out in support for H.J. Res. 109, saying that "Holding reserves against the assets held in custody is NOT standard financial services practice. The Biden Admin's SAB 121 is misguided and should be nullified."</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Holding reserves against the assets held in custody is NOT standard financial services practice. <br><br>The Biden Admin&#39;s SAB 121 is misguided and should be nullified.

Res 109, the Joint Resolution to nullify the SEC's Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) 121," <a href="https://x.com/CodyCarboneDC/status/1788263944034934964">said</a> Cody Carbone, Chief Policy Officer at The Chamber of Digital Commerce, an American advocacy group that promotes the Bitcoin industry in DC. "SAB 121 effectively prohibits trusted custodians from being able to manage digital assets."</p><p>Earlier this year, Congressmen Mike Flood and Wiley Nickel <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/sec-must-change-course-protect-bitcoin-etf-investors-opinion-1873541">co-authored</a> a bipartisan op-ed on the SEC's "flawed SAB 121 guidance," stating that "When it comes to digital asset custody, it's clear our most regulated institutions need to be at the table," expressing concern about the lack of custodian options for spot Bitcoin ETFs, which could lead to concentration risks.</p><p><em>Update: H.J.

<![CDATA[ <p><strong>Founder:</strong> Evan Kaloudis</p><p><strong>Date Founded:</strong> 2019, block 563345; incorporated in 2023</p><p><strong>Location of Headquarters:</strong> No HQ; fully remote</p><p><strong>Amount of Bitcoin Held in Treasury:</strong> Not disclosed</p><p><strong>Number of Employees:</strong> 2</p><p><strong>Website:</strong> <a href="https://zeusln.com/">https://zeusln.com/</a> </p><p><strong>Public or Private?</strong> Private</p><p>On April 26, 2024, Evan Kaloudis drew a line in the sand.</p><p>In the wake of the news of the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/bitcoin-mixing-service-samourai-wallet-founders-arrested-charged-with-money-laundering">Samourai Wallet developers getting arrested</a> and <a href="https://www.nobsbitcoin.com/phoenix-wallet-to-be-removed-from-us-app-stores-on-may-3/">Phoenix Wallet halting service to US customers</a>, he made it public that he was going to fight like hell for self-custody Bitcoin and <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/lightning-network">Lightning Network</a> wallets like the one he created, ZEUS, to continue to exist.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="zxx" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/n0ye9TcNYd">https://t.co/n0ye9TcNYd</a> <a href="https://t.co/Me5ixLeBT0">pic.twitter.com/Me5ixLeBT0</a></p>&mdash; EVAN KALOUDIS (@evankaloudis) <a href="https://twitter.com/evankaloudis/status/1783892634982859039?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 26, 2024</a></blockquote> <script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> <p>The right to privately self custody your bitcoin in the United States, he argued, had to be defended at all costs.</p><p>Kaloudis’ words cut through the tension in the Bitcoin space, especially on X, where the feeling of despair was palpable.</p><p>A week and a half after Kaloudis made his deeply felt statement, I caught up with him virtually to learn more about his plans for <a href="https://zeusln.com/">ZEUS</a> — one of the most dynamic Lightning wallets on the market today — as we move into an era where the powers that be seem to want all bitcoin in a walled garden and tied to users’ identities.</p><p><em>A transcript of our conversation, edited for length and clarity, follows below.</em></p><p><strong>Frank Corva:</strong> What is the mission of ZEUS and how is it different from other Lightning Wallets?</p><p><strong>Evan Kaloudis:</strong> Zeus really doesn't like to compromise.</p><p>We've seen a lot of wallets that'll make trade-offs for various reasons. We’ve seen wallets that want to just provide the sharpest UX at the cost of self-custody or privacy. We've seen wallets from Silicon Valley that close you into a walled garden.</p><p>Zeus wants to enable you to make Bitcoin payments your way, whether it be that you’re just starting off and want to spin up a full lightning node in your pocket [editor’s note: ZEUS enables you to run a Lightning node on your phone] or, if you're a more seasoned veteran, and you have a full node running at home. Maybe it's an <a href="https://umbrel.com/">Umbrel</a> or <a href="https://start9.com/">Start9</a>, or maybe you're even running something in the cloud with <a href="https://voltage.cloud/">Voltage</a> — you can connect to ZEUS with that, too.</p><p>There are multiple ways to connect. There are multiple backends we support. We just want to empower people to make Lightning payments as freely as possible, with as few intermediaries as possible and with as much privacy as possible.</p><p><strong>Corva:</strong> Given the recent crackdown on the Samourai developers followed by Phoenix stopping its services for US customers and then <a href="https://thedefiant.io/news/regulation/wasabi-wallet-to-eliminate-coinjoin-amid-u-s-regulatory-fears">Wasabi Wallet shutting down its coinjoin service</a>, do you feel like it’s inevitable that the authorities will target ZEUS at some point?</p><p><strong>Kaloudis:</strong> I think there's a really good chance that down the line Zeus does get targeted. It's almost an inevitability unless the outlook on Bitcoin in this country drastically changes.</p><p>And regulators have no idea how the Lightning Network works. It can be interpreted in so many different ways. But they know when they want to come down with the clamps, they have to come down strong.</p><p>That really helps put stuff in perspective for us as developers and people offering products and services. We still have a long way to go despite the great strides that we've made in the last six or seven years.</p><p><strong>Corva:</strong> It’s interesting how bitcoin’s price rising seems to have little to do with people adopting it as a medium of exchange.</p><p><strong>Kaloudis:</strong> What is the general use case of Bitcoin right now? It's just people just trading it like a stock or using it as an entry tool to gamble on shitcoins and meme coins this cycle. People don't [grasp] the technology fully. Meanwhile, the people up top are seeing the writing on the wall and trying to nip it in the bud while they can — medium of exchange is really the largest threat to them.</p><p>The Michael Saylors of the world, the Larry Finks of the world, the people offering up the ETFs who stand to benefit from number go up only would love nothing more than if everyone who was getting into it were neatly arranged and accounted for, KYC and all, and if it really didn't take hold as something people self custodied or used as a medium of exchange.</p><p><strong>Corva:</strong> Is this why in the latest iteration of ZEUS you put the node in the phone instead of assuming that people would run a node at home and then use ZEUS as a remote control of sorts? In other words, are you trying to make it easier for people to use bitcoin as a medium of exchange?</p><p><strong>Kaloudis:</strong> We really bridged a gap for them by putting it in the phone and offering up basically all the same functionality that a remote user would have.</p><p>I think ZEUS is going to really evolve pretty drastically, but our priority and our two hard lines are self custody and no KYC.</p><p>I would rather either stop offering these Bitcoin payment channels in certain jurisdictions — we already have to comply with like with OFAC — or shut the company down. </p><p>We've built such a great product that empowers so many people that even without <a href="https://terminal.lightning.engineering/explore/031b301307574bbe9b9ac7b79cbe1700e31e544513eae0b5d7497483083f99e581/">Olympus</a> (a well-connected Lightning node that ZEUS runs) and our <a href="https://docs.lightning.engineering/the-lightning-network/liquidity/lightning-service-provider">LSP</a> services, I'm confident there'd be thousands of people still using the software. And I'm sure people would continue to contribute to it at an open-source level to keep making it better.</p><p><strong>Corva:</strong> It’s disheartening to think that someone like you would even think about having to walk away from your company. There aren’t many people in this space who can build what you’ve built and this makes me think the next person with your skills might just consider not even getting started as a founder in this space.</p><p><strong>Kaloudis:</strong> With this crackdown, we’ve seen a real chilling effect. It’s a real home run for the opposing side, and there's definitely potential for things to snowball and for more people to move out of the market.</p><p>I really do hope that my actions encourage others to stand up and not self-police or leave markets preemptively.</p><p>On the other hand, if you talk to people who are developing the space or doing their own startup, they already know that what they're doing is crazy. They know that, “Hey, I can go work for one of these FAANG companies and make $200, $300 grand easily, and I make a fraction of that with a fraction of a chance of success if I go and work on Bitcoin and try to start my own company.”</p><p>But that’s the thing with Bitcoin developers — despite all the challenges that lay ahead and the pressures that are mounting, there's nothing else they'd rather do. This is a moonshot, but if it succeeds, the entire world changes. So, I think there's still going to be a lot of crazy devs.</p><p><strong>Corva:</strong> Do you think these developers will be a bit less publicly antagonistic after seeing what happened to the Samourai developers and how prosecutors are using the <a href="https://twitter.com/SamouraiWallet/status/1542533704635015168">tweet</a> in which they welcomed Russian oligarchs to use their service in the case against them? Do you think it’s better to go on the offensive verbally or to just keep your head down and work quietly?</p><p><strong>Kaloudis:</strong> Man, it's just so fun when you come out with the bravado, you know? And the Samourai guys built an entire brand around it. They essentially assembled an army of diehard fans and users and that largely contributed to their success.</p><p>If you are a nym and you have the ability, then please continue the shit talking. But if you're a public figure, it's not going to be wise to poke the bear or kick the hornet's nest, as Satoshi said.</p><p>We do need to start thinking a little more critically. There are still a lot of concessions we are going to have to make in the battles that are happening now. You need to be strategic to win a war.</p><p><strong>Corva:</strong> Let’s shift over to something more optimistic — your plans for ZEUS — and let me ask you some questions that some plebs on Nostr and X asked me to ask you. Are you exploring ways for self-custodial users to receive payments without initially having to fund a channel with Bitcoin and what would this look like?</p><p><strong>Kaloudis:</strong> Great question. On the self custodial front, there are a lot of challenges. We have people like <a href="https://twitter.com/super_testnet?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">Super Testnet</a> who have figured out really innovative ways to do things self custodially with payments, like what we've done with our <a href="https://coinsnap.io/en/what-is-a-lightning-address/">ZEUS Lightning address</a> and stuff like this new <a href="https://www.nobsbitcoin.com/introducing-hedgehog/">hedgehog protocol</a>.</p><p>The pre-funding issue still remains. It’s a tricky challenge that we're trying to address.</p><p>I ultimately think that a lot of protocol level changes have to happen to Bitcoin. Those are the things that we're more bullish on — the things that still enable self custody. We're really bullish on <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/youll-activate-the-covenants-and-youll-like-it">covenants</a>. We're really bullish on coin pools and payment pools. Stuff like <a href="https://www.arkpill.me/">Ark</a> is pretty novel.</p><p>We don't really want people to break the bank to set up payment channels. As Bitcoin's price keeps going up, it becomes more expensive, at least in dollar terms, to open your first channel and use ZEUS in a self-custodial way.</p><p>We want to try to avoid that moving forward, but it's going to take more and more plebs pushing to say, “Hey, this ossification push is stupid. It cripples Bitcoin.” And the Larry Finks, the Michael Saylor types we were talking about earlier would love nothing more than if the core code base and protocol just stayed as is. Think about who really benefits if things stay that way.</p><p>Let's be open minded as we push forward and let's see what other proposals come down the line, because there's a lot more we have to do to scale.</p><p><strong>Corva:</strong> When can you bring splicing to ZEUS?</p><p><strong>Kaloudis:</strong> Splicing is [some]thing we depend on <a href="https://docs.lightning.engineering/lightning-network-tools/lnd">LND</a> for. I'd love to bring it in, but who knows? We probably could see in the core Lightning interfaces, too. It would probably be easier to see that sooner than in say the embedded node in Zeus. More so than what it enables users [to do], it would really benefit us as the Lightning Service Provider in reducing costs.</p><p><strong>Corva:</strong> In what ways does ZEUS integrate with Nostr?</p><p><strong>Kaloudis:</strong> Zeus today has two Nostr integrations.</p><p>We have a contact book in Zeus in which you can import all your contacts from Nostr. This gives you a great way to easily send your payments to people you follow. In that way, it's sort of like a decentralized Cash App or decentralized Venmo for payments for people familiar with that in the US.</p><p>We also use Nostr to power our self-custodial Lightning address service, which is the first of its kind on a mobile wallet powered by the great Super Testnet <a href="https://www.nobsbitcoin.com/zaplocker-com-non-custodial-lightning-address-server/">ZapLocker</a> spec and basically use Nostr keys to sign off on the invoices that our server serves up to users. So, if you have a compatible ZapLocker wallet, you can say, “Oh yeah, this invoice hash, this got signed by Frank and I'll press this button to make sure I'm really looking at Frank's profile and that it's really him who signed off on it.”</p><p><strong>Corva:</strong> With all of the innovations you bring to ZEUS, do you keep existing regulations in mind as you build or do you just build and hope you’re not breaking any laws?</p><p><strong>Kaloudis:</strong> We have to act in good faith. We have already put measures up that will prevent bad actors from using our system.</p><p>We're going to have to likely show regulators, if they come knocking on our door, that it's not just a free for all here. And we have data that can help us identify and kick bad users off our platform.</p><p>I'm not going to say, “Hey, Russian oligarchs come use Olympus,” because you're not going to get far if you try to do that. ZEUS is just not conducive to that at all.</p><p>What ZEUS is conducive to is to be able to freely make your day-to-day payments.</p><p>What is guiding us is our hard lines, and our hard lines are self custody and no KYC. We’re not making payments on behalf of users. We’re just empowering them to make those payments for themselves.</p><p>If we get labeled as a money service business, then everything else goes, from individual Lightning node operators to miners potentially to self custody itself. And like I said in my post, that's the hill to die on — self custody.</p><p>The alternative is just too grim to even think about and it's going to take some individuals, largely in the United States, to stand up.</p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ <p>Ordinal Derangement Syndrome (ODS) is a real phenomenon. As a neutral observer from Bitcoin Magazine, I aim to address the misconceptions and dismissive attitudes toward Ordinals in the Bitcoin community, revealing the overlooked complexities and potential within what I term 'Ordinal Derangement Syndrome' (ODS).</p><p>ODS emerges as a significant phenomenon within a segment of the Bitcoin community, characterized by an oversimplification and dismissive attitude toward Ordinals, often cavalier in nature. As an employee of Bitcoin Magazine, who remains neutral toward Ordinals but is tired of the baseless criticism aimed not just at our publication but at Bitcoin innovations at large, I feel compelled to share my perspective. Contrary to some assertions, our coverage does not obsess over Ordinals nor provide coverage to an unreasonable extent.</p><p>The conversation about Ordinals amongst detractors is frequently reduced to unfounded accusations of scams or spam clogging the mempool, which reflects a "mid-wit" mentality prevalent among certain Bitcoin influencers. These individuals neglect the intricate details of Ordinals, opting to leverage the topic for personal gains, such as gaining more followers or enhancing their online presence. Whether these actions are intentional or not, with deliberate manipulation being especially egregious, they indicate a superficial engagement with the technology. Such behavior fails to acknowledge the complexity of Ordinals, which merits a more detailed and considerate analysis, and thus epitomizes Ordinal Derangement Syndrome (ODS).</p><p>It's disappointing to witness a portion of the Bitcoin community engage in such reductive discussions, particularly given the thoughtful reasoning that initially attracted many to Bitcoin. This tendency is most apparent among those who aligned with Bitcoin around 2020 — or the class of the fourth epoch — and whose understanding of Bitcoin is heavily influenced by "The Bitcoin Standard" and the literal interpretation of Satoshi’s blog posts on the Bitcoin talk forum. This approach, akin to the zealotry seen in religious fanaticism, has led to a skewed interpretation of Bitcoin Maximalism, transforming it into the sole identity of its adherents. At times, it's almost as if those exhibiting ODS are secretly or unwittingly supporters of Bitcoin Cash (BCash) or Bitcoin SV (BSV), given their behavior.</p><p>Some context around my personal beliefs includes:</p><p>1. Ordinals (what many refer to JPEGs on Bitcoin) are dumb.</p><p>2. I understand Ordinals have subjective value.</p><p>3. Ordinals have resurfaced bitcoin scaling issues.</p><p>4. Bitcoin is resistant to Bitcoiners.</p><p>5. Bitcoin is permissionless.</p><p><em>I have never owned, been gifted, or intended to own an Ordinal or inscription.</em></p><p>Contrary to the perception of Ordinal and Bitcoin Magazine detractors, Ordinals constitute a minimal percentage of what Bitcoin Magazine covers. Since the beginning of the year, Bitcoin Magazine has published 327 articles on its website, with only 5 covering Ordinals, constituting approximately 1.5% of our published content this year.</p><p>The navigation bar on our website includes sections for Articles, PRO (market insights), Store, Conference, Mining, Learn, Books, and Buy Bitcoin. Notably, Ordinals do not have their own dedicated section. Of the 31 print issues released, only one focused on inscriptions.</p><p>Our recent print issue, entitled "The Inscription Issue," spotlights inscriptions and Ordinals as the core of a significant cultural issue within the Bitcoin community, hence why it's called "The Inscription ISSUE."</p><p>Let me underscore some of our recent initiatives that demonstrate our broader primary interests and focus:</p><ul><li>We have formed a partnership with the industry's leading Bitcoin collaborative custody business. This collaboration is designed to provide new Bitcoin buyers with the knowledge and tools necessary for self-custody, including the setup of a multi-signature solution. More details at: <a href="https://unchained.bitcoinmagazine.com/">https://unchained.bitcoinmagazine.com/</a></li><li>Our largest content series include collaboration with one of the largest hardware wallet providers globally to promote technical content on self-custody best practices. For instance, see "10 Steps to Self-Sovereignty" at <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/sponsored/understanding-your-bitcoin-keys-bip39-seed-words">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/sponsored/understanding-your-bitcoin-keys-bip39-seed-words</a></li><li>We have also partnered with one of the biggest miners to tackle mainstream Bitcoin FUD. See "FUD Fighters" at <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/sponsored/mining-misinformation-how-the-united-nations-university-misrepresented-data-to-exaggerate-bitcoins-environmental-footprint">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/sponsored/mining-misinformation-how-the-united-nations-university-misrepresented-data-to-exaggerate-bitcoins-environmental-footprint</a></li></ul><p>Our conference team has expanded our events to Asia and the MENA regions, specifically China and the UAE. Our conferences predominantly focus on the economic, energy, and open-source benefits of Bitcoin, making up more than 90% of the conference content.</p><p>At Bitcoin 2023, our most recent flagship event, Ordinals received minor attention:</p><ul><li>Main Stage: Out of 52 talks, only 1 discussed Ordinals (the Great Ordinal Debate), representing approximately 1% focus on Ordinals.<br><br></li><li>Enterprise Stage: Out of 16 applicants for Pitch Day, 1 company presented on Ordinals (Ordinal Safe, which did not win), and 2 talk tracks of the 15 were focused on Ordinals, accounting for roughly 9% focus.<br><br></li><li>Mining Stage and Open-Source Stage: There was no focus on Ordinals.</li></ul><p>In total, only 4 out of 128 tracks touched on Ordinals, constituting 3% of the total conference programming.</p><p>Now I don’t want to speak for The Bitcoin Conference but at Bitcoin Magazine, it is our objective to cover all facets of Bitcoin, including Ordinals. To overlook Ordinals would be irresponsible, given their impact on-chain, their potential long-term consequences, and their role in transforming UTXO and block space valuation.<br><br>As an independent media outlet we platform everyone - for the sake of discussion that meets our very public editorial guidelines in order to allow individuals to come to their own conclusions. We drive discourse and welcome competing bitcoin narratives. Being selective would make us no different than FOX News, CNN, or MSNBC. </p><p>Ordinals are controversial, and addressing controversy requires more dialogue, not less. Withdrawing from a conference or criticizing an organization due to perceived "moral superiority" often reflects underlying issues like pandering, grifting, or lack of intellectual rigor.</p><p>While some might interpret this perceived moral high ground as stemming from "compassion for no-coiners or those new to Bitcoin," it's crucial to examine the situation more critically, as it often reflects dynamics similar to US Far Left Progressive Cancel Culture. Comparing these political phenomena to the unfolding politics within the Bitcoin community, one can notice the rise of "Bitcoin wokisms" and purity tests, increasingly regarded as thought leadership. To understand the potential direction of this trend, one can observe the impact of cancel culture in the United States. Here, concepts like Safe Spaces, Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI), and Make America Great Again (MAGA) have been paralleled with Bitcoin narratives:</p><ul><li>Safe Spaces are similar to those who demand for filtering bitcoin transactions.(#FixTheFilters). You could also compare ‘filterbois’ to COVID-19 vaccine mandate advocates. </li><li>The universal potential for Bitcoin adoption and advancement has been overshadowed by pejorative accusations of scamming towards those proposing scaling solutions. Similar to how DEI argues for equitable outcome, many bitcoiners are claiming that transacting on mainchain bitcoin is also equitable.</li><li>Calls to solidify Bitcoin's current state echo the MAGA movement, advocating for no change or reversion to “better times."<br></li></ul><p>Much like how the term "Nazi" has been appropriated by the far left and MAGA types were disillusioned into thinking that the economy under Trump was "just fine," we're witnessing a similar appropriation of the words "scam," "spam," and "shitcoin," with most uses being based on opinion rather than fact.</p><p>Such dilution of terms diminishes their meaning and legitimacy, leads to imprecision in public discourse, and undermines the identification of real threats. This is regrettable because, within the context of Ordinals, there are genuine scams, including artificially inflated marketplaces and affinity scams disguised as Ordinal projects run by proponents of Bitcoin SV. Rather than highlight differences, the focus has shifted to pejorative arguments against Ordinals, rather than engaging in discourse about the technical underpinnings and how we even got here in the first place, which is a far larger issue. I’m looking at all of you Bitcoin twitter folk who larped for Taproot with green square emojis!</p><p>ODS has also resulted in the emerging tendency to use Ordinals as a basis and excuse to overlook Bitcoin’s non-monetary applications, which is deeply troubling. This perspective conveniently overlooks Bitcoin’s significant innovation in leveraging stranded energy to lower emissions and secure the network and additionally, it disregards Bitcoin's capabilities in enabling proof of existence, providing timestamping solutions, facilitating decentralized domain name systems, supporting immutable messaging, and enhancing decentralized identity verification.</p><p>While Bitcoin is primarily money, ignoring its other functionalities is shortsighted and misguided. It's critical to acknowledge and explore the full spectrum of Bitcoin's applications, as restricting our view to its financial aspect alone is a limited approach.</p><p>Moreover, the belief that Bitcoin’s global adoption will mirror the individual discovery journey of its 2020 (or 4th halving) cohort is a narrow perspective. It's essential to recognize that the path to widespread acceptance and use of Bitcoin may be as diverse and multifaceted as its potential applications. Dismissing the evolving nature of Bitcoin’s adoption and utility risks sidelining oneself from the ongoing developments and conversations, especially in a permissionless environment.</p><p>Canceling discourse does not challenge discourse.</p><p>Don't be a victim of ODS. </p> ]]>

Prepared by Joe Burnett for Unchained.</figcaption> </figure> <h2>Bitcoin is a deep freeze</h2><p>As humanity continues to excel in producing goods, services, knowledge, and financial assets, we're now made painfully aware of a new problem: how ineffective our saving is when everything we save can be produced in greater quantities or devalued by competitive markets. Traditional saving methods, from dollars to real estate, are increasingly challenged by our own capacity for production, which in turn devalues these assets. Another way to think about this is that these assets are simply “bad money,” but compared to what?</p><blockquote><p>"Bitcoin is the only thing in the world that is inelastic to price."<br>- Michael Saylor</p></blockquote><p>Enter bitcoin, a paradigm shift in the concept of saving. Bitcoin stands apart as a novel monetary tool with unique properties that redefine what we consider to be money. Unlike traditional assets, bitcoin is designed with an immutable, fixed supply–there will only ever be 21 million bitcoin—making it immune to the inflationary tendencies that plague fiat currencies and all other asset classes. Bitcoin operates on a programmatic, exponentially decreasing supply schedule, enabling its initial distribution, cementing its long term scarcity, and ensuring that as more miners attempt to mine more bitcoin, mining difficulty increases indefinitely to keep the predetermined supply schedule on track.</p><blockquote><p>“There are two common arguments against bitcoin being scarce. I'll distill them down here: <br>It's not scarce because people can still create other currencies<br>It's not scarce because I don't understand fractions"<br>- Phil Geiger</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>“Only 21 million bitcoin will ever exist, and the element of trust is removed from the equation entirely. Bitcoin’s fixed supply is enforced by a network consensus mechanism on a decentralized basis. No one trusts anyone, and everyone enforces the rules independently. As an aggregate of these two functions, bitcoin is becoming the scarcest form of money that has ever existed.”<br>- Parker Lewis in Bitcoin Obsoletes All Other Money</p></blockquote><p>Immutable scarcity is at the core of bitcoin's value proposition as a savings tool. In a world where other assets can be perpetually produced or devalued, bitcoin’s fixed supply offers a permanent solution. Bitcoin's monetary properties align with the economic principle that systems tend to converge on the one most marketable tool as money. Just because something has a scarce supply doesn’t make it valuable. What makes bitcoin valuable is that it is the best money due to its superior monetary properties. </p><p>It is the world’s first perfectly scarce good with sufficient monetary properties. In contrast to all the melting assets people use as savings vehicles today, bitcoin is a deep freeze at absolute zero.</p><p>Parker Lewis explains bitcoin’s credibly enforced fixed supply as well as as anyone in his book, Gradually, Then Suddenly:</p><blockquote><p>Recognize that there is nothing about a blockchain that guarantees a fixed supply, and bitcoin’s supply schedule is not credible because software dictates it be so. Instead, 21 million is only credible because it is governed on a decentralized basis and by an ever increasing number of network participants. 21 million becomes a more credibly fixed number as more individuals participate in consensus, and it ultimately becomes a more reliable constant as each individual controls a smaller and smaller share of the network over time. <br>- Parker Lewis in Bitcoin Obsoletes All Other Money</p></blockquote><p>Money solved the double coincidence of wants—the problem of requiring two people in a barter system to have precisely what the other wants at the same time. In a barter system, if you have apples and want bananas, you must find someone who not only has bananas but also wants your apples. This makes trading incredibly difficult. Money eliminates this issue by acting as one universal tool for trading. The double coincidence of wants problem is solved by individuals within economic systems converging on one best tool to be used as money, and that best tool is now bitcoin. This is objectively true, given its superior monetary properties.</p><figure> <a href="https://bm.b.tc/your-wealth-is-melting-report" ><img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA2MjkxNDQ4MDI5NTIxNjgz/your-wealth-is-melting---newsletter-graphic-1.png" height="300" width="1200"></a> <figcaption><a href="https://bm.b.tc/your-wealth-is-melting-report">Download </a>the full 37-page report "Your Wealth is Melting". <a href="https://bm.b.tc/your-wealth-is-melting-report">Click here.</a></figcaption> </figure> <p>While all value is ultimately derived from the fact that there will only ever be 21 million bitcoin, its improvement on prior money doesn’t stop there: it’s also fungible (no unit of bitcoin can be distinguished from another), portable (it can be moved permissionlessly and globally at very low cost), durable (it’s data that can be physically preserved in many mediums), and divisible (one bitcoin equals 100,000,000 satoshis, allowing bitcoin to be used for commerce at many scales.</p><p>With bitcoin’s superior monetary properties in mind, we can begin to look at the landscape of the market through the lens of bitcoin. Because these properties stand in stark contrast to the properties of every other good, and because monetary systems converge on one money, it’s not only reasonable, but prudent to visualize traditional storeholds of wealth as measured in this superior asset.</p><h2>Your wealth is melting</h2><p>As human ingenuity and technological innovation drives greater efficiency in producing commodities, services, and information, we find that we predominantly save in assets that we, as a society, can create more of. Traditional saving methods, including holding fiat currency, bonds, stocks, gold, and real estate, are all either themselves vulnerable to being increased in quantity or devalued over time or fundamentally linked to assets that can be.</p><p>Of course there are still short, medium, and even longer term profits to be made by investing in various asset classes. How much of a given asset could exist in the world—its supply—is not the only factor affecting its price, even in the long term. However, in a world with bitcoin, we must begin to ask if they might be overvalued in light of their risk-adjusted returns:</p><p>Is holding the US dollar wise when, if there is a 2x increase in the production capacity of CPI goods, the Federal Reserve must respond to that productivity increase by debasing the currency to maintain their 2% inflation target?</p><p>Bonds are simply contracts for a future amount of US Dollars. Is holding a fixed amount of future US Dollars, with added potential default risk, wise when these Dollars will be debased by design as well?</p><p>Is Apple a good long-term storehold of wealth at a 30 P/E ratio (pay $30 for every $1 of annual earnings) when a plethora of consumer technology companies could produce similar devices or disrupt their walled garden ecosystem, diminishing the unique value proposition ultimately shrinking margins and potentially revenue?</p><p>Gold, despite its physical scarcity, is a commodity that could be mined indefinitely with sufficient technology. Is holding it wise when it can be perpetually produced?</p><figure> <a href="https://unchained.com/pricing/?utm_campaign=btcmag-launch" ><img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA2MjQ5OTUzMjc2NzMyNTky/btcmag100_100_off_promo_1200x300.jpg" height="300" width="1200"></a> <figcaption><em>Visit </em><em><a href="https://unchained.com/pricing/?utm_campaign=btcmag-launch">Unchained.com</a></em><em> for $100 off any Unchained financial services product with code “</em><em><a href="https://unchained.com/pricing/?utm_campaign=btcmag-launch">BTCMAG100</a></em><em>”</em></figcaption> </figure> <p>Is investing in an apartment complex a sound long-term store of wealth, considering the potential for real estate market saturation, where the influx of new developments could lead to a commoditized housing market, filled with fierce competition and shrinking rental yield margins?</p><p>All of these investments may be logical for some time, however, on a long enough timeline, they all face the consequences of the innovation trap—their streams of future cash flows or yield can and will be competed away—or their supply can be simply increased—by free market forces. This ruthless competition is part of why we live in a time of such severe financialization: None of these savings vehicles sufficiently preserve your wealth for the long run, so you must hire or become a money manager. </p><p>The promise of bitcoin is that it reintroduces the concept of true savings.</p><blockquote><p>“There is and always has been a fundamental difference between saving and investment; savings are held in the form of monetary assets and investments are savings which are put at risk. The lines may have been blurred as the economic system financialized, but bitcoin will unblur the lines and make the distinction obvious once again. Money with the right incentive structure will overwhelm demand for complex financial assets and debt instruments.”<br>- Parker Lewis in Bitcoin is the Great Definancialization</p></blockquote><p>Once you begin to accept that using traditional assets for long-term savings isn’t wise because bitcoin exists and has a credibly finite supply, bitcoin itself only further illuminates the problem it solves by serving as a constant to measure other asset classes against. When measured in a perfectly scarce asset like bitcoin, the ways the long-term value of all these asset classes is challenged becomes clearer than ever, particularly in an age where production capabilities are rapidly expanding and markets are increasingly global, interconnected, and highly competitive.</p><p>[END EXCERPT.

<![CDATA[ <p>It is often said that Bitcoin allows anyone to be their own bank. If you know anything about Bitcoin’s ethos and underlying tech, you’ve likely heard of this concept before. But do you know exactly how that works and why Bitcoin is more suitable as a store of value than your bank?</p><p>To get the full picture, it’s important to understand how banks work today, and how Bitcoin differs from the traditional financial system. </p><h2>The Problem With Banks</h2><p>The first problem with banks is their custodial nature, and with that, the risk of rehypothecation inherent to fractional reserve banking. If banks were simply means of warehousing cash for their clients, using them would only imply <em>counterparty risk. </em>While not ideal, this would not necessarily be a problem if banks simply let customer funds sit there, but that’s not exactly what happens. To explain, banks lend your hard-earned cash, often purchasing government bonds to collect a yield on that cash. Sometimes, a bank might lend out too much and not maintain enough liquidity to honor redemptions, and unfortunately, there’s nothing you can do about it. If the bank goes down, often, your funds go along with it.</p><p>Not only that, but the traditional financial world is gatekept. Put simply, traditional financial institutions must adhere to national and local regulations that place restrictions on how individuals can use their hard-earned currency. This problem is exacerbated in countries with strict capital controls. If government regulation can change at the drop of a hat, your funds in a bank can be put at risk. Banks and traditional financial institutions, existing at the grace of their government’s legal and regulatory system, have no choice but to comply.</p><p>In either of these situations, you’d lose out through no fault of your own. Your funds rely entirely on the bank’s integrity. This is a big risk. Banks have failed before and they will fail again. Unfortunately, centralized financial institutions just come with these types of risks. </p><h2>Why is Bitcoin the Solution</h2><p>To avoid this uncertainty, you want to store capital outside the jurisdiction of centralized entities. The only answer is to use a purely decentralized store of value, i.e. Bitcoin. Bitcoin circumvents these risks with a few features that centralized financial institutions cannot offer. </p><h3>Borderless</h3><p>Unlike banks, Bitcoin is borderless. You can access and use your funds in any country, and you can send BTC to anyone around the world. The beauty of borderlessness is that it doesn’t cost you anything more to send BTC to your next-door neighbor than it would to send it to someone on the other side of the world. Plus, unlike banks, currency exchange fees aren’t necessary. In addition, users can transact across political jurisdictions seamlessly due to the permissionlss nature of Bitcoin.</p><h3>Peer-to-peer transfer of value</h3><p>A key difference between the traditional financial system and Bitcoin is the former’s requirement of trusted third parties that facilitate transactions. This implies that a third party can approve or deny a given transaction, stymying an individual's expression of financial agency. In contrast, Bitcoin’s permissionless peer-to-peer network sidesteps intermediaries, allowing individuals to unilaterally dictate transactions between each other.</p><h3>Ownership</h3><p>An additional benefit of Bitcoin is the ability for individuals to control their funds through the power of cryptography. In essence, if someone has access to a given Bitcoin private key, they can control the flow of funds from public addresses associated with that private key.</p><p>As long as no one has access to your private keys, only you can control your Bitcoin. While there are challenges when it comes to privately and safely storing your <a href="https://www.ledger.com/academy/whats-a-private-key">private key</a> (generated from a <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/the-infosec-basics-how-to-keep-your-bitcoin-seed-phrase-secure">seed phrase</a>), you can securely use this private key to sign messages and interact with the Bitcoin network. While storing funds in a bank account allows the bank to lend out or use your funds, that’s not possible with a non-custodial Bitcoin wallet. That’s what true ownership is all about.</p><h2>To Be Truly Bankless, How You Manage Your Bitcoin Matters </h2><p>If you want to go truly bankless, it’s important to understand the cross-over of traditional financial institutions and centralized bitcoin custodians.</p><p>Centralized exchanges are businesses registered in specific countries. As such, they must comply with local laws and regulations, just like banks. Plus, they don’t allow you to manage your own private keys. The company can access your bitcoin at any time, just like a bank can with your fiat currency.</p><p>Any of these centralized institutions rely on the integrity of the banks they use. They all involve counterparty risk. If you use a crypto platform that relies on a bank, and the bank goes down, your funds go along with it. So, if you’re dead set on going bankless, make sure you take these aspects into account.</p><h2>Challenges On The Road To Banklessness</h2><p>To go bankless with Bitcoin, you know you need to embrace self-custody, but custody isn’t the only challenge. Of course, Bitcoin works a little differently from fiat currencies, so truly going Bankless with Bitcoin also has its challenges.</p><h3>Everyday Payments</h3><p>Bitcoin’s suitability as a store of value is unmatched, but it can offer a challenge for everyday payments. Bitcoin’s average block time is 10 minutes – meaning that a simple payment for an item like a cup of coffee is heavily constrained by Bitcoin’s design.</p><p>That said, there are solutions to scale both Bitcoin’s transaction speed and total throughput. For example, the Lightning network, a <a href="https://www.ledger.com/academy/bitcoin-layer-2s-what-they-are-and-how-they-work">Bitcoin Layer 2 solution</a>, provides near-instant and global final settlement of transactions while minimizing the use of the Bitcoin base layer. While Lightning is constrained by certain aspects of its design, like needing to settle on Bitcoin itself to close and open payment channels, Layer 2s like Lightning network open up the possibility of greatly scaling Bitcoin’s use as a medium of exchange.</p><p>One proposal to overcome the Lightning Network’s design constraints, as mentioned above, is the use of Chaumian ecash, where federated mints can issue redeemable certificates to users in the way that cash was at one point, a certificate of deposit redeemable for gold.</p><p>In an ecash implementation, a network of federated mints would use Lightning to settle between each other, and retail payments would take place using ecash itself. This implies that Lightning may become more of a commercial solution for scaling Bitcoin financial services, and that retail payments would take place on solutions built on top of Lightning.</p><h3>Widespread Adoption</h3><p>Of course, it’s impossible to truly go bankless with Bitcoin if it is not accepted as a medium of exchange. For now, businesses that accept bitcoin are still in the minority in most places around the world. At first, you might be searching for in-person and online shops willing to take cryptocurrencies. </p><p>However, bitcoin adoption is changing significantly. While Bitcoin is still a teenager, countless big brands accept Bitcoin today. Disney, Playstation, Microsoft, Starbucks, KFC, Burger King: the list of Bitcoin-friendly businesses is only increasing.</p><h2>Your Road To Banklessness</h2><p>In conclusion, going bankless with Bitcoin involves due diligence. For starters, you need a non-custodial wallet such as a Ledger device. But going truly bankless doesn’t end there. You must assess the platforms you use and how you use them. And finally, you must put measures in place to make your everyday transactions more feasible. </p><p>But, with those pieces in place, you're well on your way to fina</p> ]]>

The next question becomes whether to use a <a href="https://unchained.com/features/singlesig-vs-multisig/?utm_campaign=btcmag-launch">singlesig wallet or a multisig wallet</a>.<br><br>If you <a href="https://unchained.com/features/what-is-multisig/?utm_campaign=btcmag-launch">choose to use multisig</a> to secure your long-term savings, you will also need to decide whether you want to set it up all by yourself, or in collaboration with others. Both of these approaches have their own set of trade-offs, and in this article we will compare and contrast them.</p><h2>Do-it-yourself (DIY) multisig</h2><p>An attractive characteristic of bitcoin is that it allows people to become more self-sovereign with their wealth. If you’re someone who emphasizes the importance of this feature, your initial reaction to collaborative custody multisig may be one of skepticism. You might instead be considering setting up multisig by yourself, without involving anyone else in your arrangement.</p><figure> <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA2MjQ5NDM5NzU5NzcwODAw/64f87253e0c93daaacf96768_multisig-image-7.svg" height="623" width="1200"> <figcaption>The most common DIY multisig setup involves using multiple keys from hardware wallets you control</figcaption> </figure> <p>A multisig wallet can be set up by using one of several free and open source wallet softwares, such as <a href="https://unchained-capital.github.io/caravan/#/?utm_campaign=btcmag-launch">Caravan</a>, <a href="https://sparrowwallet.com/">Sparrow Wallet</a>, or <a href="https://electrum.org/">Electrum</a>. They allow you to combine extended public keys (xpubs) to build the multisig quorum you want. This approach has a couple of advantages—it gives you the opportunity to customize the structure to suit your needs and potentially retain more privacy than collaborative multisig.</p><h2>Collaborative custody multisig</h2><p>Although “collaborative custody” may seem like an alternative to self-custody, these labels are not mutually exclusive. In a thoughtfully designed multisig structure, both terms can accurately describe the same situation.<br><br>Bitcoin self-custody is typically defined by who possesses the power to spend the bitcoin. If you hold bitcoin in self-custody, then you’re the only one with unilateral power to spend your bitcoin. Collaborative custody means you're collaborating with another party to help you manage or spend the bitcoin. In a <a href="https://unchained.com/features/what-is-multisig/?utm_campaign=btcmag-launch">2-of-3 multisig</a> where you hold two keys and a collaborative partner holds one key, both features are available! You can still move your bitcoin without relying on the collaborative partner, but you can also receive assistance from them when needed. Additionally, your collaborative partner cannot move your bitcoin without your consent.</p><figure> <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA2MjQ5NDM5NzU5NzA1ODc1/64f872c17660b5df5c0180d1_multisig-image-8.svg" height="622" width="1200"> <figcaption>The most common collaborative multisig setup involves using a keys from hardware wallets you control and a partner who controls a minority of keys.</figcaption> </figure> <p>Collaborative custody multisig can be set up with two or more people. If you have someone in your life that is technical and trustworthy, you could work with that person to set up collaborative custody. However, the most popular approach is to form a partnership with a business that specializes in collaborative multisig. Choosing an established company with a great reputation will grant you access to a team of experts you can trust for help, without giving up control over your bitcoin.<br><br>If you work with one or more collaborative <a href="https://unchained.com/blog/what-is-a-bitcoin-key-agent/?utm_campaign=btcmag-launch">key agents</a>, you will simplify your setup by reducing the number of items you need to keep track of yourself. The partnership can also provide you with a resource to help you think through wallet maintenance, such as retaining the wallet configuration information, re-securing your bitcoin if a key becomes lost or compromised, navigating technical difficulties, and <a href="https://unchained.com/blog/what-is-a-utxo-bitcoin/?utm_campaign=btcmag-launch">managing UTXOs</a>. An institutional collaborative partner can provide the added benefit of actively monitoring for any suspicious activity in connection with your bitcoin wallet, as well.</p><h2>Trade-offs</h2><h3>Privacy</h3><p>As mentioned previously, collaborative custody will typically involve sharing some information with your collaborative partner about your bitcoin. This is necessary to get the most value and support out of the relationship.<br><br>In most cases, your collaborative partner will be able to see your bitcoin balance, and observe the <a href="https://unchained.com/blog/what-is-a-bitcoin-address/?utm_campaign=btcmag-launch">bitcoin addresses</a> that you interact with while sending and receiving bitcoin. This is why you should only ever consider collaborative partnerships with people or businesses you can trust to respect your privacy.<br><br>At Unchained, we are transparent about this reality. The privacy of our clients is taken seriously, and you can <a href="https://unchained.com/privacy/?utm_campaign=btcmag-launch">view the details of our privacy policy here</a>.</p><h3>Ease of setup and operation</h3><p>The biggest downside to attempting multisig on your own is the lack of reliable technical support available for you and your beneficiaries. Multisig is more involved than singlesig, and has several components that must be properly managed. Otherwise, you might find yourself in a difficult situation when trying to access your bitcoin in the future.</p><figure> <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA2MjQ5NDY3Njc2OTkyNjg4/btcmag100_100_off_promo_1200x300-1.jpg" height="300" width="1200"> <figcaption><em>Visit </em><em><a href="https://unchained.com/pricing/?utm_campaign=btcmag-launch">Unchained.com</a></em><em> for $100 off any Unchained financial services product with code “</em><em><a href="https://unchained.com/pricing/?utm_campaign=btcmag-launch">BTCMAG100</a></em><em>”</em></figcaption> </figure> <p>For example, you will need to know a little about <a href="https://unchained.com/blog/the-ticket-to-understanding-extended-public-keys/?utm_campaign=btcmag-launch">xpubs</a> and BIP 32 derivation paths to understand the specifics about how your multisig wallet is configured. This information can be found in a wallet descriptor or <a href="https://unchained.com/blog/what-is-a-multisig-wallet-configuration-file/?utm_campaign=btcmag-launch">wallet configuration file</a>, which is an important item you will be responsible for keeping in your possession. If this file is lost, then you are at risk of losing access to the bitcoin in your multisig wallet, <em>even if you still have a controlling number of keys within the multisig quorum</em>.<br></p><figure> <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA2MjQ5NDM5NzU5ODM2MzM2/6437be4fc524924ce9f46c30_group-2085662339.png" height="800" width="676"> <figcaption>A partner like Unchained can help you recover your bitcoin as long as you have access to at least one of your keys.</figcaption> </figure> <p>Additionally, with an abundance of bitcoin software and hardware designed by various parties, you may run into occasional interoperability issues that can be confusing and frustrating to navigate. These bumps in the road are not uncommon while using bitcoin, and multisig can add another layer of complexity. If you aren’t very technical, or confident about the mechanics of bitcoin and multisig, you may need to rely on outside assistance in these situations. Without an established collaborative partnership, you may be vulnerable to receiving incorrect (or even malicious) advice.</p><h3>Spending convenience</h3><p>If you want to get the most out of multisig, then you’ll want to geographically separate the keys. Keeping the keys together in the same location would resemble a more cumbersome version of singlesig. Separating the keys is what adds security and removes single points of failure, but it will also mean that it’s less convenient to make a withdrawal.<br><br>If you operate a multisig wallet on your own and separate the keys, then you will have to travel to different locations in order to take any bitcoin out of your wallet. This might not seem like a big deal, if you are holding your bitcoin savings for the long term, and have no plans for regular withdrawals. However, you could still be put into a difficult position if a situation occurred where you needed to access your bitcoin, but your movement was restricted due to unforeseen circumstances, such as a local crisis.<br><br>If you use a collaborative custody setup, such as a 2-of-3 quorum where you keep one key at home, one key away from home, and a key agent partner holds the third key, then you have an avenue to accessing your bitcoin that doesn’t require travel. You can sign a withdrawal using your key at home and call upon your collaborative partner to use their key, so that your bitcoin can be spent more conveniently.</p><h3>Inheritance</h3><p>Even if you are personally confident with the technology behind bitcoin and multisig wallets, a concern might be inheritance. If you want your beneficiaries to have access to your bitcoin in the event of your death or incapacitation, and they are not as familiar with bitcoin as you are, it can be challenging to find a good solution.<br><br>In a DIY multisig setup, creating functional instructions for your loved ones on how to find your multiple, separate keys and recover your bitcoin is not always as simple as it sounds, especially if you want to leave no room for error. Your loved one will need to know how to access and use your wallet configuration file, find your multiple seed phrases and load them into one or more hardware wallets, and use those devices to perform signatures for the withdrawal.</p><figure> <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA2MjQ5NDM5NzU5OTAxODcy/652ea9b984a70f20367c02e4_group-2085662363.svg" height="800" width="564"> <figcaption>Unchained trust or personal vaults combined with the inheritance protocol ensure that your heirs can recover your bitcoin without learning technical skills today.</figcaption> </figure> <p>Collaborative custody can make for a much smoother experience. Since your collaborative partner will typically have the wallet configuration file, one of the keys in a standard 2-of-3 quorum, and the technical expertise required for recovery, your executor or trustee will barely need to do any work at all. As long as they can access just one of your seed phrases, and they also understand they are supposed to reach out to your collaborative partner in the event of your demise, they wouldn’t need to know any additional details about how bitcoin works! Your collaborative partner could simply instruct your executor or trustee on how to load the seed phrase into a signing device and sign a transaction to move your bitcoin to the wallets of your beneficiaries.</p><p>For example, in the case of Unchained, <a href="https://unchained.com/blog/unchained-inheritance-protocol/?utm_campaign=btcmag-launch">our Inheritance Protocol</a> guides the user through everything they need to know for setting up simple and secure recovery. Our model makes it easy to safely transfer possession of your bitcoin to beneficiaries designated by a will or trust.</p><h4>Access to financial services</h4><p>One unique advantage of collaborative custody institutions is that they can grant you easy access to other bitcoin financial services. Besides inheritance, this could include <a href="https://unchained.com/bitcoin-ira">retirement</a>, <a href="https://unchained.com/trading-desk">trading</a>, <a href="https://unchained.com/loans">loans</a>, or <a href="https://unchained.com/business">other business needs</a>. If you don’t have a collaborative custody partner, you may be able to find companies that offer some of these services in the context of bitcoin. However, there is an important difference.<br><br>Collaborative custody institutions have a vested interest in a long-term relationship, because you can use your keys to permissionlessly withdraw your funds and exit the partnership at any time. Your collaborative partner can do nothing to stop this, other than provide high quality services to maintain your desire for the partnership to continue.<br><br>Other business models will not necessarily have your best interests in mind. As witnessed in recent years, many large bitcoin exchanges and lending services have demonstrated a shortsighted approach, treating client funds with gross negligence, even to the point of losing peoples' bitcoin with little opportunity for recourse. The principles of self-custody and low time-preference relationships are what can help protect you from these kinds of breaches of trust.</p><figure> <a href="https://unchained.com/pricing/?utm_campaign=btcmag-launch" ><img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA2MjQ5NDY3Njc2OTkyNjg4/btcmag100_100_off_promo_1200x300-1.jpg" height="300" width="1200"></a> <figcaption><em>Visit </em><em><a href="https://unchained.com/pricing/?utm_campaign=btcmag-launch">Unchained.com</a></em><em> for $100 off any Unchained financial services product with code “</em><em><a href="https://unchained.com/pricing/?utm_campaign=btcmag-launch">BTCMAG100</a></em><em>”</em></figcaption> </figure> <h2>Comparison chart</h2><p>Bringing back the chart from <a href="https://unchained.com/features/singlesig-vs-multisig/?utm_campaign=btcmag-launch">our article comparing singlesig wallets to multisig wallets</a> and highlighting the sections that focus on DIY multisig and collaborative multisig, we can observe the main differences in these models.<br><br>Although you may give up some privacy, collaborative custody can simplify the process of setting up your wallet, operating it securely, and building a functional inheritance plan.

If you are technically proficient with multisig and want to prioritize privacy above the benefits that are unlocked by collaborative custody, then a DIY multisig might be the best choice for you. However, collaborative custody multisig is often recommended as the best solution for the typical individual to help ensure that catastrophic mistakes are avoided.<br><br>If you pursue a collaborative custody partnership with Unchained, you can sign up for a <a href="https://unchained.com/concierge/?utm_campaign=btcmag-launch">Concierge Onboarding</a> to get your multisig vault set up properly and help you understand bitcoin security best practices.

<![CDATA[ <p>You know how the dodo bird became extinct? It became too fat to fly. </p><p>In fact, the name ‘dodo’ likely originated from the Portuguese word, ‘simpleton’. The dodo bird lived very comfortably for much of its existence on an isolated island that lacked any natural predators. Over time the dodo bird grew bigger, and its wings grew smaller. Growing larger while having no predators emboldened the mighty dodo bird to become increasingly fearless. </p><p>And then humans showed up. And everything changed. Instantly. </p><p>The rapid and dramatic environmental changes left the dodo bird helpless. Because it was flightless, it couldn’t escape. It needed wings to survive but evolutionary processes don’t occur overnight, they take thousands of years. From happy, fat, and thriving to extinction. In the blink of an eye. </p><p>That’s the harsh reality of evolutionary biology – it only optimizes based on the past and present, never the future. Evolution is a reactive process. Environments can increase a species’ resiliency over time, or it can change so rapidly that it rids itself of them completely. </p><h2>Bitcoin in its current state is a dodo bird. </h2><p>The evolutionary checkpoints for money are universally understood as:</p><p>1) Store of Value: you can preserve purchasing power with it</p><p>2) Medium of Exchange: you can use it to buy and sell things</p><p>3) Unit of Account: you can use it to measure the value of other things</p><p>Bitcoin is firmly sitting on first base regardless of what its lazy critics claim. Price volatility does not negate the store of value property and there is no question that most current bitcoin adoption is related to saving. Bitcoin as a medium of exchange is a work in progress as the reality is very few users are engaging in any kind of commerce with it. </p><p>If bitcoin is only capable of serving as a store of value and nothing more, then it cannot become money. Aspiring to be the best store of value is aspiring to be a fat flightless bird. Bitcoin is on a lonely island of less than 2% global adoption, emboldened by price appreciation, with no concern of outside predators as glowing endorsements roll in from Wall Street – flourishing and unbothered like the dodo bird.</p><p>“Like you said, evolution takes time! Bitcoin will become a medium of exchange and later a unit of account. It’s just too early right now but it <em>will happen eventually</em>.”</p><p>Will it? Why is bitcoin as a medium of exchange a foregone conclusion?</p><p>Put down the orange pom poms and look around today. Bitcoin’s current landscape has it waddling down a path that leads to nothing more than becoming a captured amorphous digital property token. The lack of situational awareness and adversarial thinking amongst bitcoiners is at embarrassingly all-time lows and seemingly getting worse the further bitcoin sleepwalks towards stasis. </p><p>If it’s not clear to you, let me wake you from this slumber so you better see the signposts: </p><h2>Signpost #1: Stablecoins</h2><p>Remember the bitcoin rallying cry, ‘separate money from state’? If you’ve forgotten it, then it’s hard to blame you with the amount of self-described bitcoin maximalists head-scratchingly rallying behind stablecoins at worst and apologizing for them at best.</p><p><em>“Bitcoin is too volatile!” </em></p><p><em>“The global south!” </em></p><p>And my personal favorite, <em>“Stablecoins are a gateway to bitcoin!”</em>. Hard to say that with a straight face.</p><p>Here’s the wakeup call. Stablecoins are fiat money. They are a gateway to fiat money. They are an adaptation of everything bitcoin was designed to escape from. They are bitcoin’s biggest sheep in wolf’s clothing competitor. Full stop. They mostly run on Ethereum and Tron. If people want to use them that’s totally fine – but enough with pretending that stablecoins complement bitcoin in any constructive way. </p><p>Do you think the US Treasury is going to just idly sit by without sinking their talons into these stablecoins? The path of least resistance for the government to introduce a CBDC is to simply regulate stablecoin issuers with an iron fist. Their money, their rules. </p><p>What happens when we’ve sleepily conceded bitcoin’s medium-of-exchange evolution phase to heavily regulated stablecoins? Will people suddenly become enlightened and retreat to bitcoin overnight? It’s a warm and fuzzy thought until you consider that the government would unquestionably restrict stablecoins being exchanged for bitcoin. Their money, their rules.</p><p>And what’s to stop stablecoins from covering so much surface area as a medium of exchange that it never concedes any ground? Gresham’s Law posits that “bad money drives out good” which means people tend to spend the bad money and save the good money. However, in absence of legal tender laws, Thiers’ Law comes into play where “good money drives out bad” as the superior form of money is naturally preferred. If we abdicate bitcoin as a medium-of-exchange to stablecoins, then what incentives will there ever be to scale bitcoin as a medium-of-exchange? Gresham’s Law will take root and Thiers’ Law will be little more than an idealist fantasy relegated to underground markets and fringe circular economies. </p><p>“The market is signaling they prefer stablecoins for spending.”</p><p>This isn’t pearl clutching over the market being wrong. It’s an ominous warning that bitcoin’s destiny is not written in stone. If it is never optimized to be used as a medium of exchange, it will never be used as a medium of exchange. If we are not relentless in our pursuit to advance bitcoin’s monetary evolution, then it will not happen. </p><h2>Signpost #2: Bitcoin ETFs</h2><p>Wall Street’s foray into bitcoin was an inevitability at some point in its life cycle. But what is striking is how quickly Wall Street arrived (less than 15 years of bitcoin’s existence) and the velocity of their entrance (daily trading volume in the billions of dollars). While today many bitcoiners applaud the new Bitcoin ETFs as a welcomed milestone for the ‘normalization’ of bitcoin, down the road this likely plays out differently from what they hope.</p><p>“Now that bitcoin is mainstream and in people’s retirement accounts, the government will never be able to ban it. It will be too politically untenable.” </p><p>A comment <em>almost</em> as ridiculous as thinking stablecoins are a gateway to bitcoin. </p><p>There’s not much debate that it is more convenient to purchase a Bitcoin ETF than it is to self-custody your own bitcoin. Market forces always compel people to seek the most convenient solution, especially when they have no consideration for the associated tradeoffs. </p><p>The hard pill to swallow is the fact that most people are not interested in self-sovereignty. They don’t want to become their own bank. And no, they don’t want to hear your long winded histrionic about fiat currency. </p><p>It boils down to: </p><p>1) Click a few buttons in my retirement account?</p><p>or</p><p>2) Go through a KYC/AML process on an unfamiliar bitcoin exchange, buy an unfamiliar hardware device, research how self-custody works, safeguard and manage private keys, etc.</p><p>If self-sovereignty disinterests you and all you want is bitcoin exposure – it’s a no brainer. You choose Option 1. And over time what this looks like is the next wave of adopters will seek exposure through ETFs – not taking direct custody of bitcoin themselves. Admittedly this concern doesn’t exist for the parts of the world that lack access to US financial markets – however allow me to point back to Signpost #1: stablecoins. The global south will seek refuge in stablecoins before pursuing bitcoin. The dollar isn’t hyperinflating any time soon and those who claim it will have been wrong on that call now for decades. </p><p>Now play this out. The next broad wave of adopters buying a financial product accelerating the amount of bitcoin held by the most regulated institutions on the planet. </p><p>The act of self-custodying bitcoin will be reduced to a suspicious and odd exercise. </p><p>“That’s weird. Nobody uses it as money. What’s the point of holding it yourself?” </p><p>And as the coffers of regulated custodians fill up with bitcoin supply, the surface attack density for those who self-custody will increase. And increase. </p><p>Financial institutions will not rally behind the self-sovereign bitcoiner. They do not care that the entire purpose of bitcoin was to disintermediate trusted third parties (i.e. literally them). In fact, their financial incentives are such that they have minimal interest in supporting self-custody as they make money on you giving your bitcoin to them. When the time is right, they are more likely to lobby against self-custody than to support it. And that time is when there are enough bitcoiners whose sole exposure is through these ETF’s and consequently wouldn’t care about defending the right to self-custody. Remember, you’re the weird one now doing it the <em>wrong way</em>.</p><p>This isn’t conjecture; self-custody is already under attack. The self-sovereign bitcoiner will become low hanging fruit. And saying you lost your bitcoin in a “boating accident” when you’ve purchased all your bitcoin on a KYC exchange is going to do you as much good as the dodo bird’s stubby wings. </p><h2>Signpost #3: Ossification</h2><p>The race for monetary supremacy is in full force. Where are we at? Stablecoins are dominating bitcoin as a medium of exchange and ETFs already hold close to 5% of total bitcoin supply in less than three months of trading.</p><p>Cool. So what are we doing about it? The price of bitcoin as a representation of purchasing power is paramount but it has become a sedative for adversarial thinking. Don’t get it twisted – the bitcoin price is a magnet, not a shield. As the price climbs so will the insatiable desire from governments to capture it. Do you think they will just let you opt out and ride into the sunset so easily? Oh, you sweet, summer child. </p><p>Sedated by paper gains, a non-insignificant amount of drawbridge bitcoiners are advocating for bitcoin’s ossification. Bitcoin, which <em>*checks notes*</em> is supposed to be money, is still not yet a medium of exchange, but is now somehow good enough as-is?</p><p>I’m willing to acknowledge that there are probably well-intentioned bitcoiners in the ossification camp who simply believe bitcoin can only be destroyed from within via protocol changes and that the battles to come can be won with bitcoin as it exists today. I’d respond to such line of reasoning with a quote from Sun Tzu, </p><p><em>“Victorious warriors win first and then go to war, while defeated warriors go to war first and then seek to win."</em> </p><p>Put simply – you do not win battles without preparation. Failing to plan is planning to fail. Bitcoin has not won. There’s less than 2% adoption globally and the wolves are at the door. Bitcoin hasn’t even surpassed the market cap of Amazon and you want to spike the football? </p><p>And for those in the pro-ossification camp purely out of selfish motivations because you got your bag and you’re just biding time to dump it later – are you certain it will be that easy? Wouldn’t your motivations be better served if bitcoin didn’t become low hanging fruit for government capture? Do you think in an increasingly adversarial environment, with no vibrant bitcoin circular economy, you will just be able to unload your stack on Coinbase sight unseen, no questions asked? Woof. </p><p>Scaling and enhancing bitcoin in a judicious manner so that it can mature into a medium of exchange should be paramount to bitcoiners. No, this is not a torn page from the big block, “buy a coffee with bitcoin” because “babies are dying”, playbook. The security and decentralization of the base layer is a non-negotiable primitive. You cannot have sturdy money on a wobbly base. However, we cannot be complacent with settling on bitcoin as just a store of value and then idly hope it becomes a medium of exchange when there is a dearth of layer two solutions beyond the Lightning Network which isn’t without its own limitations. </p><p>The introduction of ordinals has been a hotly contested cultural topic amongst different factions in bitcoin. The entire debate can be synthesized down to monetary maximalism (money only) vs platform maximalism (anything within consensus rules is okay). The debate is held at the margins and the overwhelmingly silent majority doesn’t really care for three main reasons:</p><p>1) they hardly know what ordinals are because it is such a niche subsection within bitcoin’s ecosystem</p><p>2) ordinals in their current format is just repackaged tech for people to gamble and engage in financial nihilism</p><p>3) bitcoin is still working just fine</p><p>The silent majority reaches the appropriate logical conclusion that expending mental bandwidth fretting over something that cannot be stopped and that doesn’t even hinder their ability to use bitcoin, is an utterly meaningless exercise in futility and virtue signaling.</p><p>The blind spot for the anti-ordinals crowd is the severe lack of introspection regarding the available block space due to a lack of ‘honest’ financial transactions. The pro-ordinals crowd doesn’t even dispute that all use cases other than bitcoin as money are unquestionably subordinate. People are inscribing nonsense because the barrier to entry is low enough to do so. </p><p>Every bitcoiner needs to eat this slice of humble pie: the apex use case for bitcoin is currently competing for block space with digital beanie babies. </p><p>Philosopher Epictetus said, “If you wish to be a writer, write.” The question we need to be asking is not “How do we stop the digital beanie babies?” it should be, “What are we doing to propagate more financial transactions?”</p><p>Unfortunately, the emotional response to ordinals comes with a call for ossification. Rather than harness the courage of a stoic competitor, some would rather take the ball and go home. For them, the specter of unforeseen consequences outweighs the benefits of bitcoin becoming money. The irony is that ossification kneecaps bitcoin such that it will become ensnared as only a store of value. No medium of exchange just means more available block space to incubate other arbitrary use cases. </p><p>Don’t like ordinals? Use bitcoin.</p><h2>Sign Post #4: “Don’t spend your bitcoin”</h2><p>There is a steadily repeating mantra amongst the bitcoin intelligentsia that you should not spend your bitcoin. “Savings technology”, “pristine asset”, “Buying land in Manhattan 100 years ago”, “store of value”, “Buy it and don’t touch it for 10 years”, etc. These are the prevailing bitcoinisms indoctrinating the latest waves of bitcoin adopters. The introductory value system individuals adopt when first arriving to bitcoin is demonstrably impermeable. Each cultural skirmish in bitcoin’s chronology is heavily influenced by whatever prevailing narrative surrounded bitcoin at the time they first became a user. It’s no coincidence that the existing ordinals squabble is a divide comprised mostly of longtime versus newer bitcoiners. People’s understanding of bitcoin is heavily influenced at the onset. If what they hear is “don’t spend your bitcoin” it reinforces the notion that bitcoin isn’t really money. Paring this with an explanation that bitcoin as a medium of exchange will happen at some point in the distant future, only perpetuates the falsehood that bitcoin is inevitable so there is no motivation for any change. Secure your bag and let some faceless future generation figure it out, eh?</p><p>Bitcoiners can agree to be disagreeable but can we at least agree to stop telling people what to do with their bitcoin? It’s supposed to be money. Do whatever you want with it. Don’t allow your actions to be enslaved by dogmatic rhetoric. Freedom money does not come with instructions. </p><h2>Now what?</h2><p>This isn’t a thesis to advocate for any specific BIP or scaling solution. It is a bucket of cold water to implore bitcoiners to have some self-awareness of the current path bitcoin is taking. Bitcoin is just software. What it eventually becomes is based on how users interact with the software. There is nothing inherent within the software that preordains bitcoin to become money. That outcome is completely dependent on the users – if they want it. </p><p>The dodo bird didn’t need wings – until it did. We can submit ourselves to the laws of evolutionary biology, do nothing, and see how this all plays out. Or we can do what the dodo bird couldn’t – adapt with foresight. Bitcoin does not win or reach escape velocity as solely a store of value. It is the foundation, not the destination. In the race for monetary supremacy, there is nothing the competition would want more than for bitcoin to stagnate as a store of value. </p><p>Because it’s at that point bitcoin will have become too fat to fly. </p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ <p>A little under a year ago, I <a href="https://twitter.com/bergealex4/status/1674454861096660998">announced on Twitter</a> the idea of the Bitcoin Script Project. To say it was well received would be an understatement. Bitcoiners were craving something they could hang onto in the middle of the bear. Glimmers of hope were on the horizon and I intended to magnify those and hopefully rally the industry around a new technological narrative. Unfortunately, life had other plans and, to make a long story short, I quickly realized I bit off more than I could chew at the time. </p><p>The Bitcoin Script Project never saw the light of the day. At best, it was a short-lived social awareness campaign. It seeded some ideas and moved the conversation forward. At the very least, it’s probably why I have the privilege of working on this column today. I bring this up because my experience is no different than the one of hundreds of individual who have tried to leave their mark on Bitcoin. It’s a humbling and thankless affair. Bruised egos are commonplace. Many have left far more blood, sweat, and tears than I have on this front. </p><p>Every once in a while though, stars align and our collective actions start transcending each individual’s own interests. You see, Bitcoin moves at its own rhythm. Try to push the pace and the whole dance is thrown off. This synchronization act requires serious patience. </p><p>Last week, just as the walls appeared to be closing in, the dance company finally got its act together. And it was beautiful. After a long hiatus, optimism is back and has finally shaken off the fear, uncertainty, and doubt. The opportunity ahead has galvanized the developer community to undertake perhaps its most ambitious work yet.</p><h2>Make Script Great Again</h2><p>As I entered the halls of the Palmer Events Center in Austin on Wednesday morning, it was hard to ignore the flashbacks from days long gone. <br><br>Back in 2015, an eerily similar event took place in Montreal, Canada, and set the tone for the next decade. <a href="https://montreal2015.scalingbitcoin.org/">Scaling Bitcoin</a> came at a critical junction in the project’s history – just as the community struggled to define its vision for the future. The event was a who’s who of a then young, nascent industry. The entirety of Bitcoin’s figurative brain under one roof. Scary, in hindsight.</p><p>I digress, but <a href="https://btcplusplus.dev/conf/atx24#agenda">Bitcoin++</a> last week had similar vibes. You could tell right away there was a special energy in the building and the crowd was no less stellar. A stark contrast from the average conference roadshow and the online antics we’ve become accustomed to. </p><p>No billboards, no 280-character tirades, and most importantly, no sales pitch.</p><p>At the onset of the conference, it was hard to ignore the momentum behind the OP_CAT proposal. Its staunchest proponents were likely preparing for the event to be its consecration. Rough consensus appeared within reach and even those who had originally dismissed it were coming around to the idea.</p><p>As fate would have it, at least one person had other plans, and in the first few minutes of his presentation, the implications dawned on everyone present. </p><p>"<a href="https://t.co/tQJQoWepcK">The Great Script Restoration Project</a>" is Blockstream developer Rusty Russell’s attempt to flip the proverbial script on everyone. It’s a journey to contemplate the “why” behind the kerfuffle of script and covenant proposals thrown around these days. What are we trying to achieve? </p><p>How about fixing Bitcoin script and returning it to its former glory?</p><p>For context, a significant portion of Bitcoin’s script capabilities was precipitately removed in 2010 when it was uncovered that certain functions were liable to resource exhaustion attacks (DDoS). Rather than address the underlying issue, Satoshi took an axe to everything he thought might be affected and the mangled, hacky byproduct is what we’re left with today. A lot of the conversation up to now has revolved around patching scripts with bandaids here and there to restore some functionality. This has inevitably dragged us into the deadends of horse trading and bikeshedding. </p><p>The restoration project flips this approach on its head and proposes we take the proper engineering steps to get there. If we agree on the destination, we should embrace this opportunity to change Bitcoin for the better. Political, social stigmas, and ossifiers be damned. This latter point cannot be emphasized enough. Intentional or not, Rusty’s presentation feels like a call for developers to liberate themselves from dogma and embrace science anew. <br><br>It turns out the best way to rope developers in is to nerd-snipe them with data, benchmarks, and measurements. I’ll leave it to more technical folks to lay out the details of his framework but it’s worth pointing out why it has proven so effective. By offering a model to account for the cost of each associated change, Rusty allows us to unite them all under the same umbrella. This is a significant departure from the existing framing which pitted every proposal against one another. Instead, we work together to fix what was previously abandoned and thought to be broken using thoughtful engineering.</p><h2>Trust the process</h2><p>To be clear, "The Great Script Restoration Project" hardly qualifies as a proposal yet. It is but a loose collection of ideas and some very early suggestions about how we might approach them. The reason it has gained so much traction in such a short time is that it is an opportunity to do things differently. To finish Satoshi’s work.</p><p>For the first time in a long, long time, some outlines of rough consensus are shaping up. Maybe not around a proposal, but at least around a process. That’s progress.</p><blockquote><p>“Let’s be engineers. Let’s be objective and let’s have rational arguments about this stuff. Yes, we will have to convince the rest of the world but that’s much much easier if we’re all pulling in the same direction”. - <a href="https://twitter.com/bergealex4/status/1786933357575606594">Christian Decker</a></p></blockquote> ]]>

If you look beyond the popular narratives, however, you might find there is more to the story than first impressions suggest. Here are six reasons to consider owning at least some bitcoin during retirement.</p><h3>1. Bitcoin helps broaden your asset allocation base</h3><p>Traditionally, investors use a strategy called <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/assetallocation.asp">asset allocation</a> to distribute and shield funds from investment risk over time. A sound asset allocation strategy is the antidote to putting all of your eggs in one basket. There are several types of asset “classes” or categories over which to distribute risk. Customarily, advisors seek to establish a dynamic mix between debt instruments (i.e., bonds), equities (i.e., stocks), real estate, cash, and commodities.</p><p>The more categories you employ to distribute your assets and the less correlated those categories are, the better your chances of balancing your risk, at least theoretically. Recently, due to unintended consequences caused by the aggressive expansion of societal debt and the money supply, assets that were previously less correlated now <a href="https://www.fidelityinternational.com/editorial/blog/chart-room-why-stockbond-correlations-are-turning-positive-03685b-en5/">tend to behave more in kind with one another</a>. When one sector gets hammered today, several sectors often suffer together.</p><p>Regardless of these present-day conditions, asset allocation remains a well-conceived strategy for moderating risk. While still in its relative infancy, bitcoin represents an entirely new asset class. Because of this, owning at least some bitcoin, especially due to its <a href="https://unchained.com/blog/bitcoin-not-blockchain/?utm_campaign=btcmag-launch">distinct properties when compared to other “cryptocurrencies</a>,” provides an opportunity to broaden your asset base and more effectively distribute your overall risk.</p><h3>2. Bitcoin offers a hedge against inflation and currency debasement</h3><blockquote><p>As a retiree, protecting yourself from inflation is crucial to preserving your long-term purchasing power. In the asset allocation discussion above, we referenced the recent and aggressive money supply expansion. Everyone who has lived long enough to approach retirement age knows that a dollar no longer buys what it used to. When the government issues large amounts of new money, it <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/debasement.asp">debases</a> the value of the dollars already in circulation. This generally pushes prices higher as newly created dollars begin to chase the existing limited supply of goods and services.</p></blockquote><p>Our own Parker Lewis <a href="https://unchained.com/blog/dollar-crisis-to-bitcoin/?utm_campaign=btcmag-launch">touched on this extensively</a> in his <em>Gradually, Then Suddenly</em> series:</p><blockquote><p>In summary, when trying to understand bitcoin as money, start with gold, the dollar, the Fed, quantitative easing and why bitcoin’s supply is fixed. Money is not simply a collective hallucination or a belief system; there is rhyme and reason. Bitcoin exists as a solution to the money problem that is global QE and if you believe the deterioration of local currencies in Turkey, Argentina or Venezuela could never happen to the U.S. dollar or to a developed economy, we are merely at a different point on the same curve.</p></blockquote><p>In contrast to fiat currencies, no one can increase the supply and arbitrarily reduce bitcoin’s value. There are no centralized authorities that govern its monetary policy. Despite <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4398232-bitcoin-is-not-hedge-against-inflation">arguments to the contrary</a>, bitcoin is similar to gold—but not exactly, because gold miners continue to inflate the supply of gold each year at a rate of 1-2%.</p><p>As bitcoin is slowly introduced to the circulating supply (i.e., mined), its inflation rate decreases and will eventually cease. This fact makes bitcoin uniquely scarce among global monetary assets. Ultimately, this scarcity, along with bitcoin’s other monetary properties, should safeguard its purchasing power. As such, owning bitcoin during retirement offers you a hedge against inflation.</p><figure> <a href="https://unchained.com/pricing/?utm_campaign=btcmag-launch" ><img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1NjkwMDEzMjkwMDc5Njg1/irabm_pro_bundle_newsletter_1200x300-1.jpg" height="300" width="1200"></a> <figcaption><em>Get $100 off Unchained IRA and receive 1-year free of Bitcoin Magazine Pro market research ($250 value).

Bitcoin offers an opportunity for asymmetric returns</h3><p>Bitcoin’s capacity to mitigate many of the challenges we discuss here rests on its ability to achieve asymmetric returns. Its supply is fixed (there will only ever be 21,000,000 bitcoin), and demand for the asset is growing steadily. As this limited supply collides with increased store-of-value adoption from individuals, institutions, and governments, bitcoin has the potential to dwarf the returns of nearly every competing asset class.</p><p>It’s worth noting that people generally improve their returns with bitcoin when they hold it for the long term. In the modern era, retirements lasting decades or more are increasingly common. Over such time periods, even a limited allocation to bitcoin offers ample opportunity to benefit from its upside potential. You just need time to hold through the short-term volatility, which contrary to popular belief, is <a href="https://unchained.com/blog/bitcoin-is-not-too-volatile/?utm_campaign=btcmag-launch">not evidence of it being a poor store of value</a>.</p><p>Sequestering a portion of funds solely for appreciation during retirement runs somewhat counter to conventional wisdom. Modern retirement planning generally optimizes for the liquidation of portfolio funds to provide income. However, setting aside a small amount of bitcoin—kept steadfastly gated from funds earmarked for income—opens the door to benefit from the monetization of bitcoin’s limited supply.</p><h3>4. Bitcoin offers protection from the risk of long-term bonds</h3><p>Conventionally, high-grade bonds—held directly or as fund shares—make up a <a href="https://finance.zacks.com/percentage-retirement-funds-should-bonds-be-4536.html">significant part of most retirement portfolios</a> due to their low risk levels and tendency toward capital preservation. However, things have changed.</p><p>Monetary expansion and increases in societal debt have forced bond yields—or the amount of interest paid (i.e., coupon)—to historically low levels. The yields on most bonds today fall well below the rate of inflation. This “negative real yield” means that owning a bond can cost you money. But the difficulty doesn’t end there.</p><p>Because retirees need funds from their portfolios to pay bills, they generally must sell assets at current market rates to derive income throughout retirement. In the case of bonds, at present, this can be very problematic. Consider the following equations.</p><ul><li>How much money does it take for a bond paying a 2% rate to yield $20? Answer: $1,000. ($1,000 x 2% = $20)</li><li>How much money does it take for a bond paying a 4% rate to yield $20? Answer: $500. ($500 x 4% = $20)</li></ul><p>These two equations reveal that to yield the same $20 return, the market value of the underlying bond changes based on the interest rate promised.</p><ul><li>When interest rates go up, the market value of bonds goes down.</li><li>When interest rates go down, the market value of bonds goes up.</li></ul><p>The market value of bonds has an inverse relationship to interest rates. Consider that interest rates today hover near historic lows. Over the next twenty to thirty years, what will happen to the market value of bonds held by retirees if interest rates increase substantially? The answer: the market value of their bonds will collapse.</p><figure> <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA2MTgxNDM4NjE2MjQ5NDQz/220418_bond_yields_6_reason_to_own_bitcoin_in_retirement_illustrations_1920x1080.png" height="675" width="1200"> </figure> <p>This changes the entire risk paradigm for bonds in retirement portfolios and potentially makes them far less safe than typically imagined. Bitcoin exists in a separate asset class from bonds; it is a bearer instrument that is not exposed to the same money market risks. As such, owning bitcoin may help you offset at least some of the potential risk incurred from owning bonds in retirement.</p><h3>5. Bitcoin offers a potential solution for long-term healthcare risk</h3><p>Another area of concern for retirees is the cost of healthcare. Here, I am not referring so much to ordinary medical bills but rather to the potential to incur long-term care expenses in later age. Insurance is available for long-term care, but it has some unique and increasingly difficult challenges to overcome.</p><p>Healthcare, in general, takes a double-hit when it comes to price inflation. Not only do healthcare costs rise due to monetary debasement, but healthcare faces additional headwinds from demand spurred by <a href="https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2020/65-older-population-grows.html">growth in the aging population</a>.</p><figure> <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA2MTgxNDQzOTg0OTU4ODc1/retirement-age-increase-chart-prev3-1024x652.png" height="764" width="1200"> <figcaption>Source: <a href="https://acl.gov/sites/default/files/Aging%20and%20Disability%20in%20America/2020ProfileOlderAmericans.Final_.pdf">Administration for Community Living – 2020 Profile of Older Americans</a></figcaption> </figure> <p>States regulate insurance for long-term care. To keep policyowners safe, insurers face scrutiny over where and how they invest policy premiums. To preserve capital required for future claims, insurers generally rely on low-risk, intermediate and long-term bonds. However, as our discussion above on bonds reveals, low yields and the potential for rising rates complicate this practice. One immediate fallout is that premiums for long-term care insurance policies have risen substantially.</p><p>We noted earlier bitcoin’s usefulness as an inflation hedge and its potential for long-term price appreciation. As it relates to long-term healthcare, it may make sense to set aside some bitcoin explicitly dedicated as a hedge for this rapidly increasing expense.</p><h3>6. Bitcoin offers you individual sovereignty</h3><p>The final reason we’ll consider for owning bitcoin in retirement is that it offers you increased individual sovereignty. Bitcoin provides you a level of ownership that is not achievable with other assets. It can easily be carried across borders with <a href="https://unchained.com/blog/what-is-a-bitcoin-seed-phrase/">a hardware wallet or seed phrase</a>, for example, or transferred peer-to-peer anywhere in the world at low cost.</p><p>If you hold bitcoin securely in a wallet you control, no central bank can steal the value of your bitcoin by printing it into oblivion. No CEO can dilute its value by issuing more of its “shares.” Nor can a bank arbitrarily block access to or confiscate your funds. Unlike centralized financial custodians, which can be ordered to freeze or withhold funds on the whims of government or other third-party authorities, bitcoin with keys properly held is resistant to these kinds of overreach.</p><p>Specifically for retirement purposes, you can also hold your own keys for bitcoin in an IRA. Products like the <a href="https://unchained.com/bitcoin-ira/?utm_campaign=btcmag-launch">Unchained IRA</a> are a robust tool for building and saving your wealth on a tax-advantaged basis. And holding your bitcoin keys in the form of a multisig collaborative custody vault allows you to eliminate all single points of failure while you do so.</p><figure> <a href="https://unchained.com/pricing/?utm_campaign=btcmag-launch" ><img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA2MTYyMDM2NjM4MzYwNjc1/btcmag100_100_off_promo_1200x300-1.jpg" height="300" width="1200"></a> <figcaption><em>Visit </em><em><a href="https://unchained.com/pricing/?utm_campaign=btcmag-launch">Unchained.com</a></em><em> for $100 off any Unchained financial services product with code “</em><em><a href="https://unchained.com/pricing/?utm_campaign=btcmag-launch">BTCMAG100</a></em><em>”</em></figcaption> </figure> <h3>Sound financial principles and owning bitcoin</h3><p>Benefitting from bitcoin does not require committing to wild speculation or thoughtless abandonment of sound financial principles. In contrast, the more you look at bitcoin through sound financial principles and apply them to your thinking, the greater the opportunities it provides. One steadfast financial principle that coincides with bitcoin ownership is prudence.</p><p>Macro-economic investment strategist Lyn Alden often speaks of establishing a “non-zero position” in bitcoin (i.e., owning at least some). The risk of losing a few portfolio percentage points in a worst-case scenario is, in my estimation, worth the potential upside. But to be clear, each person’s situation is unique. You must do your own research and make the best decisions you can about what works in your particular scenario.</p><blockquote><p>Originally published on <a href="https://unchained.com/blog/top-10-bitcoin-multisig-tips/?utm_campaign=btcmag-launchhttps://unchained.com/blog/six-reasons-bitcoin-retirement/?utm_campaign=btcmag-launch">Unchained.com</a>.<br><br><a href="https://unchained.com/utm_campaign=btcmag-launch">Unchained</a> is the official US Collaborative Custody partner of Bitcoin Magazine and an integral sponsor of related content published through Bitcoin Magazine.

<![CDATA[ <p>“The institutions are coming.”</p><p>Anyone who’s been in the Bitcoin space for any significant period of time has heard some prominent figure within the space utter this phrase.</p><p>In August 2020, when <a href="https://www.microstrategy.com/">MicroStrategy</a>, an American-based business software company, announced it would be <a href="https://fortune.com/2020/08/11/buying-bitcoin-microstrategy-cryptocurrenc/">purchasing bitcoin</a> to add it to its treasury, many thought that was the beginning of the institutional stampede.</p><p>But it wasn’t.</p><p>Sure, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/08/tesla-buys-1point5-billion-in-bitcoin.html">Tesla bought some bitcoin</a> the following year, only to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/07/20/tesla-converted-75percent-of-bitcoin-purchases-to-fiat-currency-in-q2-2022.html">dump 75% of it</a> soon after.</p><p>And so from 2020 through 2023, MicroStrategy was an anomaly. During these years, the company — led by Bitcoin permabull Michael Saylor — remained the only major corporation on Earth to convert a notable portion of its treasury into bitcoin.</p><p>Saylor’s vision to get MicroStrategy on a bitcoin standard hasn’t wavered, though.</p><p>Instead, he has doubled down and continued to guide MicroStrategy as it has put more bitcoin on its balance sheet. He’s also hosted a conference — MicroStrategy World: Bitcoin for Corporations — every year starting the year after his company made its first bitcoin purchase as a means to show other companies how to emulate MicroStrategy.</p><p>This year’s edition of the conference — held on May 1 and 2 in Las Vegas, NV — marked the beginning of a new era, according to Saylor, an era in which the time has come for institutions to follow MicroStrategy’s lead.</p><h2>The Age of Bitcoin For Institutions and Corporations Has Begun</h2><p>In Saylor’s keynote presentation on the second day of the conference entitled “There Is No Second Best”, he termed 2020-2023 the “crazy years” in the Bitcoin space.</p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/S3T4nhtHxOA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><p>He explained that these years were part of a period of “crypto chaos,” a period from which bitcoin emerged as the dominant and most trusted crypto asset.</p><p>What follows the crazy years, Saylor said, are the years in which institutions and corporations embrace Bitcoin, and he told Bitcoin Magazine in an <a href="https://x.com/BitcoinMagazine/status/1785414016397197667">X Spaces</a> on April 30, the day before the conference began, that he believes this new era began in January 2024, when <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/approved-spot-bitcoin-etfs-to-trade-on-us-markets-in-historic-milestone">11 spot Bitcoin ETFs launched</a> in the United States.</p><p>Let’s not just take Saylor’s word that a new day has dawned, though. Let’s consider what Hunter Horsley, CEO of <a href="https://bitwiseinvestments.com/">Bitwise</a>, one of the 11 financial institutions that launched a spot Bitcoin ETF in the US, had to say about institutional interest in bitcoin.</p><p>“The bitcoin ETFs have really brought bitcoin into the realm of possibility for a lot of traditional financial institutions,” Horsley said on a panel during the second day of the conference.</p><p>“A lot of traditional and reputable firms have started engaging with bitcoin in a way they never have before, but so few of them are saying anything about it. If you just scroll through your LinkedIn or you read press releases, you would think that nothing has changed versus last year, but, for now, most — or many — are preferring not to have it be public,” he added.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">JUST IN: $3.5 billion Bitwise CEO says &quot;A lot of traditional and reputable firms have started engaging with <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bitcoin?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Bitcoin</a> in a way they never have before, but so few are saying anything about it.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Banks are reaching out to us&quot; 👀 <a href="https://t.co/h0jjhrzZQ6">pic.twitter.com/h0jjhrzZQ6</a></p>&mdash; Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) <a href="https://twitter.com/BitcoinMagazine/status/1786133907051536807?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 2, 2024</a></blockquote> <script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> <p>Alexander Leishman, CEO and CTO, of Bitcoin exchange <a href="https://river.com/">River</a>, also pointed out in his presentation that while buying bitcoin has traditionally been a retail investor-driven phenomenon, more and more businesses are beginning to dip their toes into the bitcoin waters, as well.</p><p>In one of his slides, Leishman pointed out that the percentages of businesses and funds/ETFs that hold bitcoin may not seem like a lot, but they’re bigger than they’ve been in previous years.</p><figure> <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA2MTc4NzQ0MDYxMTQyMTE1/screenshot-2024-05-03-at-64243am.png" height="590" width="1200"> <figcaption>Alexander Leishman, CEO and CTO of River, explained how the percentage of businesses and funds/ETFs owning bitcoin is still small but has been increasing.</figcaption> </figure> <p>“We have businesses, funds and ETFs and governments, these large institutions, these blue and black bars. These bars have gone from virtually nothing to where they are today, but they’re continuing to grow,” Leishman said.</p><p>“Retail is not really driving the recent rally in the bitcoin price. Consumer interest in bitcoin is nowhere near its all-time highs. So, what is driving this price increase? We think that one big factor is institutions,” he added.</p><p>According to David Marcus, CEO of <a href="https://www.lightspark.com/">Lightspark</a>, in the near future, institutions won’t just be looking to hold bitcoin on their balance sheet or offer it to their customers, but they’ll start using it for payments.</p><h2>Lightspark Is Using Lightning To Link Businesses Globally</h2><p>To conclude the first day of the conference, Saylor sat down for a fireside chat with Marcus, <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/former-paypal-meta-executive-on-bitcoin-lightning-payments">former executive at PayPal and former lead for Facebook’s abandoned cryptocurrency project Libra</a>, to discuss how the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/lightning-network">Lightning Network</a> will connect businesses across the world.</p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DCeJ5A1CgmE" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><p>Lightspark <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/coinbase-integrates-bitcoin-lightning-for-100-million-users">made headlines</a> the day before the conference began, as it announced Coinbase would be using Lightspark to integrate Lightning for its US users.</p><p>According to Marcus, Coinbase was just the first of many companies that would soon be harnessing the power of Lightning.</p><p>“In a world where you’ll have hundreds of millions if not billions of people that have an address for money that can be settled in real time in the currency that they’re choosing, you can imagine all kinds of new applications [for businesses],” said Marcus about companies using Lightning to not only send sats, but digitized versions of fiat currencies, as well. </p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">&quot;The time is now to enable fast cheap, realtime movement of Bitcoin and other assets [on Lightning].&quot;<br>-David Marcus, CEO, LightSpark <a href="https://twitter.com/lightspark?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@lightspark</a><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/BitcoinforCorporations?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#BitcoinforCorporations</a></p>&mdash; MicroStrategy (@MicroStrategy) <a href="https://twitter.com/MicroStrategy/status/1785813796490985710?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 1, 2024</a></blockquote> <script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> <p>“Streaming money to endpoints is one of them.

It also allows you to deploy applications that run on MicroStrategy Orange. The Orange SDK allows you to integrate the applications into your own services. And the Orange apps are going to be prepackaged solutions that address specific digital identity challenges.”</p><p>This news came as a pleasant surprise to many at the conference, as it illustrated that MicroStrategy wants to continue to lead the way with Bitcoin adoption — outside of its store of value use case — as we enter this new era of businesses and institutions adopting Bitcoin.</p><h2>Normalizing Bitcoin For Corporations</h2><p>Conversations both on and off the conference stage revolved around Bitcoin maturing from a taboo entity, to something that’s becoming more normal, making it more difficult to ignore for companies and institutions.</p><p>In conversations I had with Bitcoin industry leaders like Becca Rubenfeld, COO of <a href="https://anchorwatch.com/">AnchorWatch</a>; Sam Abbassi, founder and CEO of <a href="https://www.hoseki.app/">Hoseki</a>; and Nathan McCauley, co-founder and CEO of <a href="https://www.anchorage.com/">Anchorage Digital</a>, I learned that companies and institutions that once wrote Bitcoin off as being little more than a scam or fad, are now beginning to inquire about how they can adopt it.</p><p>“It’s exciting to be at a stage of adoption where access to bitcoin is being expanded to businesses and their clients,” Rubenfeld told Bitcoin Magazine. “This event is particularly oriented to that, which allows conversation to be focused on the benefits and challenges unique to that new set of Bitcoin owners.”</p><p>While it’s taken some time for corporations to come around to Bitcoin, it’s clear that we’re at the onset of an era in which they’re beginning to see the value in it.</p><p>Even if companies and institutions aren’t necessarily ready to adopt a bitcoin standard the way that MicroStrategy has, it does seem that more are willing to have some exposure to bitcoin the asset or begin using Lightning for payments or apps that utilize the Bitcoin blockchain.</p><p>For this, we have Michael Saylor and the team at MicroStrategy to thank.</p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ <p>In a Keynote address at <a href="https://www.microstrategy.com/world-2024/bitcoin-for-corporations">MicroStrategy World: Bitcoin for Corporations</a>, MicroStrategy Executive Chairman Michael Saylor delivered a masterclass on corporate finance and the power of bitcoin to supercharge corporate balance sheets. Saylor made a point to emphasize Bitcoin as the <em>single </em>solution for capital appreciation in an inflationary environment.</p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/S3T4nhtHxOA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><p>In his speech, Saylor likened the cost of capital to being the benchmark which a company must surpass to <em>increase</em> its purchasing power, arguing that “Bitcoin is the <em>only</em> asset that exceeds the cost of capital. Another way to say that,<em> </em>is<em> everything else is dilutive</em>.”<br><br>Further describing the <em>true </em>cost of capital, he noted that the “S&P is the modern surrogate for the cost of capital… If you had to pick one metric and say, what's the metric that gives you a sense of how rapidly the world currency supply is expanding in dollars? Probably the S&P 500… this is another way to see inflation.”<br><br>Saylor went on to emphasize his belief that all assets, except bitcoin, are not accretive to corporate balance sheets despite their general acceptance. In particular, he highlighted the relative underperformance of the silver, gold and US government bonds:<br></p><figure> <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA2MTYwMTk2NzgxODc2MzIz/screenshot-2024-05-02-at-34739pm.png" height="674" width="1200"> </figure> <p>“[If companies] invested in T-bills, they're going to get 3% after tax against a 12% cost of capital per year. And so you hold $100 billion of capital, you destroy $9 billion of shareholder value a year… The story here is that the bonds don't hold value, right? They're awful capital assets. Silver doesn't work. Gold doesn't keep up with the cost of capital.”</p><h4>There Is No Second-Best Crypto Asset</h4><p>The MicroStrategy Executive Chairman noted key differences between Bitcoin and alternative cryptocurrencies like Ethereum, expressing the importance and necessity of proof-of-work-based consensus in creating a digital commodity.<br><br>“You could see the writing on the wall when the spot ETF of Bitcoin was approved in January. By the end of May, you'll know that Ethereum is not going to be approved. And when Ethereum is not going to be approved, sometime this summer it'll be very clear to everyone that Ethereum is deemed a crypto asset security, not a commodity. After that, you're going to see that [for] Ethereum, BNB, Solana, Ripple, Cardano – everything down the stack.”</p><figure> <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA2MTYwMTk2NzgxNzQ1MjUx/screenshot-2024-05-02-at-34853pm.png" height="674" width="1200"> </figure> <p>On the point of Bitcoin’s energy use, Saylor invoked the idea of a “physical linkage to the real world” in Bitcon’s consensus. He described the network as having “raw digital power standing in the way of anybody that would try to undermine the integrity of the network… The network is feeding on electricity, and that creates a decentralizing dynamic that drives all of the network to the end of the grid in the quest of stranded energy.”</p><figure> <a href="https://unchained.com/pricing/?utm_campaign=btcmag-launch" ><img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA2MTYyMDM2NjM4MzYwNjc1/btcmag100_100_off_promo_1200x300-1.jpg" height="300" width="1200"></a> <figcaption><em>Visit </em><a href="https://unchained.com/bitmag/trading-desk/?utm_campaign=btcmag-launch">Unchained.com</a><em> for $100 off any Unchained financial services product with code "</em><a href="https://unchained.com/bitmag/trading-desk/?utm_campaign=btcmag-launch">BTCMAG100</a><em>"</em></figcaption> </figure> <h4>It’s Going Up, Forever</h4><p>Saylor’s conviction and use of physics-based metaphors were present as ever as he spoke on Bitcoin’s price appreciation and continued monetization. “It's never declining. The chart's not ever decreasing. It only goes one way. Bitcoin is a capital ratchet. It's a one-way ratchet. Archimedes said, give me a lever long enough and a place to stand and I can move the world. <em>Bitcoin is the place to stand.</em>”</p><p>“There's no more powerful idea than the digital transformation of capital… No force on earth can stop an idea whose time has come. This is an idea. Its time has come. It's unstoppable. And so I'm going to end with the observation that Bitcoin is the best. The best what? The best.”</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTJCgFUVy3o">Watch the full MicroStrategy World: Bitcoin for Corporations Day 2 Livestream on the Bitcoin Magazine YouTube Channel</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ <p>The last six months or so have seen several proposals for improvements to Bitcoin Script: <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/op-cat-the-purr-fect-solution-for-covenants-">CAT</a>, 64-bit arithmetic, as well as some older ideas (CTV) and far-future ideas (Chialisp and <a href="https://blog.blockstream.com/simplicity-language/">Simplicity</a>). This activity has largely overshadowed some revolutionary changes in our understanding of the existing Bitcoin Script, changes which form the basis of BitVM but which may also form the basis of other, equally-exciting improvements.</p><p>This article tries to summarize and organize research into Script by other people. I make no claim to originality or authorship of anything described here.</p><h2>Bitcoin Script</h2><p>As many readers are aware, Bitcoin Script is a simple programming language embedded in the Bitcoin blockchain, which is used to control under what conditions coins may move. By far the most common use of Script is to simply check a signature with a single signature verification key. Though Bitcoin addresses have changed throughout the years, every form of address has supported this use of script in a first-class way: signing keys can be encoded directly into Bitcoin addresses, and wallets know how to expand these keys into full programs that check signatures on those keys.</p><p>Script can do many more things: it can check hash preimages, check relative and absolute timelocks, and it can do some simple reasoning to combine these checks in various ways. This is the premise behind Miniscript: we can generalize the notion of expanding a key into a Script to the notion of expanding an arbitrarily-large set of signing conditions into a Script.</p><p>Script can technically do even more than this: it can add and subtract 32-bit numbers, it can hash data and check the hash values for equality, and it can rearrange and manipulate a "stack" of values in various interesting ways. However, Script has many limitations: it lacks opcodes to do simple arithmetic such as multiplication, it is (nearly) incapable of reasoning about objects larger than 32 bits, and it has (nearly) no ability to introspect transaction data. The latter limitation is why covenant support appears to require a softfork, and the former limitations are why Script, until recently, was never used to compute any "interesting" functions.</p><p>For example, to multiply two 16-bit numbers in Script, using only the addition and subtraction opcodes that Script provides, you need to break them into bits (by requiring the bits be provided as witness data, then doubling and adding them to reconstruct the original number) and then implementing multiplication in terms of additions of these bits. The resulting code would involve several dozen opcodes for a single multiplication.</p><p>Prior to Taproot, Script had an artificial limit of 201 opcodes per program, and with individual multiplications taking more than a quarter of this budget, it was impossible to do much of anything. After Taproot, the 201-opcode limit was removed, but every opcode still takes up a witness byte, meaning that multi-kilobyte programs would be prohibitively expensive for ordinary wallets to put on the blockchain.</p><p>And without transaction introspection, it isn't even clear what large computations would be good for. </p><p>After all, if you can do arbitrary computations on arbitrary values, but those values aren't tied to transaction data on the blockchain, how can those computations add useful semantics to Bitcoin?</p><h2>Lamport Signatures</h2><p>Lamport signatures were invented in 1979 by Leslie Lamport -- though they are insecure without modern cryptographic hash functions, which did not exist until the 1990s -- and are one of the few cryptographic objects from that era which endure to this day. Their lasting popularity comes from their simplicity and the fact that their security against quantum computers depends only on sufficiently-random-looking hash functions, unlike more modern and efficient proposals for quantum-secure signature schemes.</p><p>However, Lamport signatures come with two large drawbacks: (1) they are horribly inefficient, taking multiple kilobytes of data for both keys and signatures, and (2) they are single-use. This means that if a user signs more than one message, it becomes possible for a 3rd party to forge more messages, making all signatures effectively worthless. This can be mitigated, for example by having your “public key” be a Merkle tree of millions of single-use keys, but this stretches the bounds of practicality..</p><p>These limitations have made Lamport signatures popular as a "backup signature scheme" for Bitcoin in case of a quantum computing breakthrough, but have prevented their use as primary signatures in any widely deployed system.</p><p>The way they work is simple: assume that the message to be signed is 256 bits wide. This can be assured by first running an arbitrary-length message through the SHA256 hash function. The user's public key consists of 256 pairs of hashes – 512 in total. To sign a message, they reveal a preimage for one hash in each pair, choosing the preimage to reveal based on a bit of the message.</p><p>A signature verifier re-hashes the message and preimages to ensure they are all consistent.</p><p>In 2021, <a href="https://rubin.io/blog/2021/07/02/signing-5-bytes/">Jeremy Rubin posted a blog post</a> claiming that Bitcoin Script can directly verify Lamport signatures on 33-bit values. His mechanism was very clever. Bitcoin Script does not have an opcode to read individual bits from a number, nor can it do the bitwise operations needed to construct a number from bits. But Script does have an opcode to add two numbers, and by adding different numbers where each has only a single bit set, it is possible to bitwise-construct or bitwise-deconstruct a number.</p><p>Using this insight, Rubin checks a Lamport signature, encoded as a series of hash preimages, as follows:</p><ol><li>For each preimage, compute its hash and compare it against a pair of target values (comprising the public key) embedded in the Script.</li><li>If the hash matches the first member of the pair, this is a 0-bit; the script does nothing in this case.</li><li>If it matches the second member, this is a 1-bit. In this case, add a particular power of 2 to an accumulator.</li><li>(If it matches neither member, the signature is invalid and the script should abort.)</li></ol><p>The final value of the accumulator will then equal the signed number, constructed by adding powers of two corresponding to each 1 bit in its binary expansion.</p><p>Already this is interesting: it means that for certain kinds of "oracle signature" applications, you can directly check signatures in Bitcoin Script, assuming you have an oracle that is willing to produce one-time Lamport signatures on specific events and that you know a Lamport public key in advance for each event. For example, a specific sports match outcome can be encoded as a single bit. The particular score can be encoded using a few bits. A particular timestamp can (probably) be encoded in 33 bits. And so on. And of course, by checking multiple Lamport signatures, you can effectively get signatures on as many bits as you want.</p><p>Without the ability to sign large messages, you can't get a signature on transaction data and therefore can’t get covenants. (<a href="https://groups.google.com/g/bitcoindev/c/mR53go5gHIk">Or can we?</a>)</p><h2>BitVM and Equivocation</h2><p>This blog post by Jeremy Rubin was largely considered to be a curiosity at the time and was lost among larger discussions around his OP_CTV proposal and covenants. In December of 2023, it was indirectly cited in the <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/1525">OP_CAT BIP by Ethan Heilman and Armin Sabouri</a>, which gave it a fresh audience among people who were thinking differently about Bitcoin Script.</p><p>People were thinking differently because in October 2023, just two months prior, Robin Linus had <a href="https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2023-October/021984.html">announced on the mailing list his project BitVM</a>—an ambitious project to do arbitrary computations in Bitcoin Script by splitting programs across multiple transactions. The individual transactions each do a single simple operation, with outputs from one operation hooked to inputs of another via a hash-preimage-revealing construction that looks suspiciously similar to a Lamport signature.</p><p>The trick here is that if a user Lamport-signs multiple messages with the same key, the result will be two hashes in the same hash-pair whose preimages are both known. This is easy to check for in Script, which can be used to construct a "slashing transaction" that will take coins from a user if they do this. Such a slashing transaction would then become valid exactly in the case that a user publicly signed two messages with the same key. Slashing transactions are used within multi-transaction protocols to punish users who misbehave, typically by forfeiting a bond that they must post ahead of time.</p><p>So these Lamport signatures, rather than merely losing security when they are used more than once, can be configured to actively punish a user who signs multiple times. This has obvious applications for an oracle signature where a signer is supposed to attest to exactly one outcome of a real-life event; we want to disincentivize such a signer from claiming that e.g. both teams won a particular sports match. But this is an even more powerful idea than it seems.</p><p>In the cryptographic literature, when a party reveals two values for something that is supposed to be unique, this is called equivocation. We can <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2810103.2813686">think of a slashing transaction as an anti-equivocation measure</a>, because it punishes any signer who produces signatures on the same key with the same message.</p><p>Then our Lamport signature with anti-equivocation construction has the effect of mapping public keys to specific and immutable values. In other words, we have a global key-value store accessible from Script, with the curious property that each entry in the global store can be set by a specific person (the person who knows the preimages for that key), but can only be set once for all time. This key-value store is also accessible from any Bitcoin transaction (or a transaction on any blockchain, really) regardless of its connection to other transactions.</p><p>This key-value store has on the order of 2^256 entries, most of which are not accessible since nobody knows the preimages to their keys, so while it is a "global key-value store" shared by every possible program using this Lamport signature construction, it cannot fill up and there is no risk that data from one program might accidentally clobber data from another, or that a value which should be set by one user might be set by another. Nor is the key-value store actually stored anywhere in its entirety.</p><p>BitVM and its variants use this fact to tie the output of one operation to the input of the next: a given program can be split into a long series of basic operations, for example opcodes in the RISC-V instruction set, and each of these basic operations can be implemented by a self-contained Script program which looks up the operation's inputs and outputs in the key-value store, checks that they are related correctly, and somehow punishes the user if not.</p><p>The complete BitVM system is much more complicated than this: for each program, it carves out an addressable memory space from the key-value store; each operation needs to look up its inputs and outputs from this memory space; each operation needs to track a program counter and other state beyond its inputs and outputs; and the whole thing is tied together with interactive protocols and trees of unconfirmed transactions to ensure than slashing penalties are correctly enforced and that even a single incorrect step in a multi-billion-step program can be zeroed-in-on and punished. But this article is not about BitVM and we will not explore this.</p><h2>Interlude: Small Script and Big Script</h2><p>We take a moment to remind the reader that Script can only do non-trivial computations on values that are 32 bits wide or smaller. Such values are "scriptnums" and Script has many opcodes to manipulate them by interpreting them as signed integers or boolean values, sometimes as both.</p><p>Using BitVM or a similar mechanism to split Script programs across multiple transactions, you can do arbitrary computations in Small Script, from ZKP verification to proof-of-work checking to number factoring.</p><p>Values that are larger than 32 bits can only be manipulated by a small set of narrow-purpose opcodes: they can be hashed, interpreted as public keys or signatures to check a transaction signature, their size in bytes can be computed, and they can be moved around the stack as opaque blobs. The only "real" general-purpose computation that can be done on them is a check for equality, which by itself provides very little value.</p><p>We describe the world of 32-bit values as "Small Script", which is computationally expressive but cannot access transaction data in any way. The world of larger values we call "Big Script", and can access transaction data through the CHECKSIG opcode. It is also possible to check hash preimages in Big Script, and this is essential to implementing Lamport signatures, but that's pretty much the only thing you can do in Big Script.</p><p>It is impossible to usefully bridge the two worlds: you can hash a Small value to get a Big value, but you cannot then learn anything about the Big value that you didn't already know. And you can use the SIZE opcode to learn the size of a Big value, but if this value represents a hash, public key or signature, then its size is fixed so you learn nothing new. (Although prior to Taproot, signatures had a variable size, and it is <a href="https://groups.google.com/g/bitcoindev/c/mR53go5gHIk">possible that you can extract transaction information</a> from a suitably constrained CHECKSIG-passing transaction.)</p><p>All this to remind the reader that, while this new Script functionality is exciting, it provides a lot of computation expressivity without the ability to inspect transaction data, and therefore cannot be used for vaults or other covenant applications. </p><p>The <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/1525">CAT opcode</a> provides a mechanism to bridge the two Scripts, which is why CAT is sufficient to provide covenants. This is also why there are so many ways in which Script "almost" supports covenants, or in which non-covenant-related proposals like CAT turn out to enable covenants: pretty much any opcode that takes Small values and outputs Big ones, or vice-versa, can be used to feed Big Script transaction data into a Small Script general program. Even a sufficiently bad break of the SHA1 opcode could probably be used as a bridge, because then you could do "computations" on Big values by interpreting them as SHA1 hashes and finding Small preimages for them.</p><h2>Interlude: Wormholes</h2><p>Actually, there is a way that you can get covenants in Small Script, assuming you have enough computational power. By going "outside" of Script, users can validate the Bitcoin blockchain itself, as well as the transaction that contains the Script (it needs to avoid directly encoding its own data to avoid being infinitely-sized, but this can be done by indirect means; see the next section for more details), and then impose additional constraints on the transaction by imposing those constraints on this internally-validated "view" of itself.</p><p>This idea could allow the creation of some limited covenant functionality, but it is important to remember that correct access to the key-value store, which is necessary in order to split large computations, is not directly enforced. Instead, some additional mechanism needs to be imposed to enforce slashing penalties on incorrect access. This greatly complicates the implementation of vault-like covenants whose functionality depends on certain spending patterns actually being impossible, not just disincentivized.</p><h2>Tic-Tac-Toe</h2><p>Thus far we have talked about the anti-equivocation feature of Lamport signatures, and how this can be used to effect a "global key-value store" in Bitcoin Script, which in turn can be used to pass data between Script programs and to split large computations into many independent parts. But there is another interesting and perhaps surprising aspect of Lamport signatures, which is that they allow committing to a unique value in a script without that value affecting the TXID of its transaction.</p><p>This has two consequences: one is that we can commit data in a transaction without affecting its TXID, meaning that we can potentially change parameters within a Script program without invalidating chains of unconfirmed transactions. The other is that we can commit data without affecting the signature hash, meaning that users can "pre-sign" a transaction without first knowing all of its data.</p><p>(By the way, these properties apply to any signature scheme, provided there is a check to punish the signing of multiple values. What is interesting about Lamport signatures is that we can use them in Bitcoin today.)</p><p>The ability to put data into a Script program without affecting the TXID of the contained transaction opens the door to constructions in which a program is able to refer to its own code (for example, by injecting the TXID itself into the program, which is a hash of all transaction data including the program). This is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quine_(computing)">Quining</a>, and can be used to enable delegation and to create recursive covenants. This ability is the motivation behind the disconnect combinator in Simplicity. However, since we can only validate Lamport signatures in Small Script, which excludes objects as large as txids, it appears that there is currently nothing we can do in that direction. However, nothing is stopping us from emulating non-recursive covenants with similar tricks.</p><p>Let's describe <a href="https://github.com/supertestnet/bitvm-workshop">an example due to supertestnet on Github</a>.</p><p>Consider the game tic-tac-toe, played between two people who take turns marking a three-by-three grid. The rules are simple: no player may mark an already-marked square, and if either player marks three squares in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) then they win. Imagine that these players want to play this game on-chain, representing each turn by a transaction.</p><p>Of course, in parallel to these transactions, they would have a single “happy path” transaction where both parties would just sign coins over to the winner so that if they agreed on the events of the game, they wouldn’t actually need to publish the individual turns! But it’s important to also construct the full game transcript so that in the case of disputes, the blockchain can mediate.</p><p>One approach they might take is to model the game as a series of pre-signed transactions, which each require a signature from both players. The first player has nine possible moves. So the second player would sign all nine, and the first player would sign whichever one they wanted to take. Then for each of the nine possible moves, the second player has eight moves; so the first player signs all eight, and the second player picks one to sign, and so on.</p><p>It turns out that this doesn’t quite work – because either player might refuse to sign a particular move, there is no way to assign blame in the case that the game stalls out, and therefore no incentive for the losing player to complete the game. To prevent this situation, each player must sign all of his counterparty’s moves before the game starts. Then a player can only refuse to sign his own moves, and this can be easily disincentivized by adding timelocked forfeit conditions to the transactions.</p><p>As an alternative to having each player sign the other players’ moves, a trusted third party could be enlisted to pre-sign each move. But the result is the same: every possible series of transactions must be signed. For the tic-tac-toe game, there are 255168 paths for a total of 549945 pre-signed transactions. This is pushing the bounds of practicality, and it’s clear that such a strategy will not generalize to nontrivial games. For chess, for example, these values are bounded below by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shannon_number">Shannon number</a>, which is 10^120.</p><p>The reason that we have such a large blow-up is that we are distinguishing between moves by distinct transactions which each must be set up before the game has started.</p><p>However, using Lamport signatures, we can do much better:</p><ul><li>Each game of tic-tac-toe has (at most) nine moves,</li><li>Each of which is a transition between two board states, that are small enough to be Lamport-signed,</li><li>And each transition must obey rules which are simple enough to reasonably encode within Script.</li></ul><p>We can therefore approach the game differently: each player generates a Lamport public key with which to sign the game state after each of their moves (so the first player generates 5 keys, the second player 4). They then generate a series of 9 transactions whose output taptrees have three branches:</p><p>1. A “ordinary move” branch, consisting of</p><ul><li>An ordinary signature from both players;</li><li>A Lamport signature on the previous game state from the appropriate player,</li></ul><ul><li>A Lamport signature on the next game state from the other player,</li><li>And a check, implemented in Script, that the two-game states are correctly related (they differ by exactly one legal move by the correct player).</li></ul><p>2. A “win condition”, consisting of</p><ul><li>An ordinary signature from both players;</li><li>A Lamport signature on the previous ga)me state from the appropriate player,</li><li>A check, implemented in Script, that this player has won the game.</li></ul><p>3. A “timeout” condition, consisting of</p><ul><li>An ordinary signature from both players;</li><li>A relative timelock that has expired.</li></ul><p>The final transaction, in place of an “ordinary move” branch, has a “draw” branch, since if all moves have completed without a win, there is no winner and presumably any coins at stake should go back to their original owners.</p><p>As before, each player pre-signs all transactions, of which there are 27, including “win condition” transactions (which send all the coins to the winning player), “timeout condition” transactions (which send all the coins to the player who didn’t time out) and “draw condition”.</p><p>And by the way, while the rules of Chess are a fair bit more complicated, and the board state may require multiple 32-bit values to represent, and there may be more than 9 moves, it is still feasible to carry out exactly the same construction.</p><h2>Transaction Trees</h2><p>In the previous example, we took great advantage of the fact that the rules of tic-tac-toe can be embedded in Script itself, meaning that a user cannot usefully sign an invalid game state. (If they sign an invalid move, the transaction representing the move will be invalid, and the transactions representing all future moves will also be invalid because they depend on it. So all the attacker will have accomplished is leaking part of his Lamport signing key, allowing the other player to potentially forge moves on his behalf.</p><p>We also took advantage of the fact that our complete protocol was not very long: at most 9 moves. This means that if one player refuses to complete the game, or completes the game but will not acknowledge the result, it is reasonable to publish the entire game transcript on-chain as a recourse. For many games this is sufficient.</p><p>It is out of scope of this blog post, but there are many tricks we can play with this model: checking single-party computations as a “game” between a prover and verifier, outsourcing one or both roles, combining multiple steps into single transactions with large taptrees, replacing the linear transcript with a binary search for invalid steps, and so on. These tricks form the basis for BitVM, BitVM 2, BitVMX, and so forth.</p><p>Using such tricks, we can reduce the cost of existing protocols that depend on trees of unsigned transactions. A classic 2017 Bitcoin paper by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.05390v1">Bentov and Miller</a> argues that stateful protocols in the UTXO model always suffer an exponential blowup relative to analogous protocols in the account model, e.g. on Ethereum. Using Lamport signatures as a global key-value store, we can partially refute this paper. But we are out of space and will need to explore this in our next post!</p><h2>Acknowledgments</h2><p>I would like to thank Robin Linus and Ethan Heilman for reviewing an early draft of this post.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Andrew Poelstra.

<![CDATA[ <p>Asset management giant BlackRock says it is seeing growing interest in <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/tags/bitcoin-etf">Bitcoin ETFs</a> from institutional players like sovereign wealth funds and pension funds. </p><p>This comes after a hugely successful debut for BlackRock's Bitcoin ETF, iShares IBIT, which was approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission earlier this year.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">BREAKING: Blackrock says “Sovereign wealth funds, pension funds and endowments” are coming to <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bitcoin?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Bitcoin</a><br><br>Institutions are coming big time 🚀 <a href="https://t.co/GLcpMJYkYz">pic.twitter.com/GLcpMJYkYz</a></p>&mdash; Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) <a href="https://twitter.com/BitcoinMagazine/status/1785993887024087247?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 2, 2024</a></blockquote> <script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> <p>The U.S. spot Bitcoin ETF market has exploded in 2024, crossing $200 billion in volume since launch. Recent 13F filings <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/second-largest-european-bank-is-buying-bitcoin-etf-13f-sec-fillings">have shown</a> major institutional buyers making small allocations to these newly regulated Bitcoin products.</p><p>Now, despite a recent cooldown and outflows from Bitcoin ETFs amidst market volatility, BlackRock remains bullish on institutional demand long-term. The firm's head of digital assets, Robert Mitchnick, said in an interview he expects sovereign wealth funds, pensions, and endowments to start trading spot Bitcoin ETFs in the coming months.</p><p>Mitchnick stated that BlackRock has been in educational conversations with these institutions about Bitcoin for years. The asset manager is unfazed even after iShares IBIT saw its first-ever outflows this week following 71 straight days of inflows.</p><p>Mitchnick believes the current lull will be followed by a new wave of buying from deep-pocketed institutional players. As more giants like BlackRock build multi-billion dollar Bitcoin reserves, it validates Bitcoin as an investable asset class.</p><p>The ETF conversations also come as BlackRock CEO Larry Fink has softened his once critical stance on Bitcoin.</p><p>With iShares IBIT quickly accumulating over $17 billion in Bitcoin, BlackRock has proven the massive latent demand for regulated Bitcoin investment vehicles.</p><p>Despite short-term ETF outflows amid volatility, its long-term outlook remains highly optimistic.</p><figure> <a href="https://bm.b.tc/unchained-bmag-dot-com" ><img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA0MzE5MTg5MTE1NDc5NDkz/bm-x-unchained-article-cta---learn-more.png" height="507" width="1200"></a> <figcaption><em>Click the image to learn more.</em></figcaption> </figure> <p>As Mitchnick stated, "Many of these interested firms – whether we're talking about pensions, endowments, sovereign wealth funds, insurers, other asset managers, family offices – are having ongoing diligence and research conversations, and we're playing a role from an education perspective."</p><p>All in all, such educated, pragmatic institutional interest bodes well for the continued growth of the Bitcoin ETF market.</p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ <p>Korok Ray, Bitcoin researcher and Associate Professor at the Mays Business School at Texas A&M University, announced plans to launch The Bitcoin Research Institute to drive academic research at the intersection of Bitcoin and artificial intelligence.<br><br>At the <a href="https://www.microstrategy.com/world-2024/bitcoin-for-corporations">MicroStrategy World: Bitcoin for Corporations 2024</a> event, Ray made note of Bitcoin’s potential to enable secure multi-party computation (MPC), offering the example of poker players agreeing on the state of a particular game as a basic form of computation.</p><p>He expanded this example to include deep neural networks and agent-based reinforcement learning, whereby artificially intelligent agents could collectively perform computations in the context of the Bitcoin blockchain. Ray’s vision made note of new developments in the Bitcoin ecosystem such as BITVM, which allows off-chain Turing complete computation, as in the case of MPC, to be verified on Bitcoin.</p><blockquote><p>For more on BitVM read: <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/the-big-deal-with-bitvm-arbitrary-computation-now-possible-on-bitcoin-without-a-fork">"The Big Deal With BitVM: Arbitrary Computation Now Possible on Bitcoin WIthout a Fork"</a> by Shinobi, Bitcoin Magazine Technical Editor</p></blockquote><p>Ray went on to propose his thesis, describing Bitcoin and AI combined as "The Undiscovered Country":</p><figure> <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA2MTM4MzcyMTczODY2NDk1/screenshot-2024-05-01-at-53419pm.png" height="683" width="1200"> <figcaption>Korok Ray at MicroStrategy World: Bitcoin for Corporations 2024</figcaption> </figure> <p>"The ultimate use case of Bitcoin in say one-hundred, two-hundred or five-hundred years, will not be humans, but machines...  as we are at [this] wave of massive technological progress, I believe the biggest opportunity will be deep integration between machines and the entire Bitcoin network at different levels."</p><p>“The Bitcoin Research Institute is really to connect these two areas of research and development and bring Bitcoin together with a lot of the major advances in AI,” Ray explained. “There is an army of researchers and faculty out there, and we need [to bring] the best minds onto Bitcoin to make this a reality.” </p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lwqLXaYoavE" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><p>For additional areas of research, Ray noted the potential rise of Chaumin mints as a means of scaling bitcoin payments, as well as the need for secure prediction markets enabled by Bitcoin, an innovation that may lead to more efficient insurance and financial products. <br><br>Ray’s speech also acknowledged the legacy of academic achievements in computer science that have led to both the creation of Bitcoin and artificial intelligence, suggesting that the two will build upon this success in research to drive innovation across all sectors of the economy.<br><br>Watch Korok Ray’s speech on the MicroStrategy World: Bitcoin for Corporations Livestream hosted on the Bitcoin Magazine <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwqLXaYoavE">YouTube</a>, <a href="https://x.com/BitcoinMagazine/status/1785768340700692598">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7191534089848422400">LinkedIn</a>.</p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ <p>MicroStrategy revealed its latest innovation today, a decentralized identity (ID) platform built on the Bitcoin network, named MicroStrategy Orange, at the <a href="https://www.microstrategy.com/world-2024/bitcoin-for-corporations">MicroStrategy World: Bitcoin for Corporations 2024</a> event.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">JUST IN: MicroStrategy launches an enterprise platform for building decentralized identity applications on <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bitcoin?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Bitcoin</a> — MicroStrategy Orange 👀 <a href="https://t.co/P5PXz80kSD">pic.twitter.com/P5PXz80kSD</a></p>&mdash; Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) <a href="https://twitter.com/BitcoinMagazine/status/1785795672345583834?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 1, 2024</a></blockquote> <script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> <p>"Today, I'd like to introduce MicroStrategy Orange, which is an an enterprise platform for building decentralized identity applications on the Bitcoin blockchain," said Cezary Raczko, Executive Vice President at MicroStrategy. "The platform consists of three fundamental pieces. At the heart of it is a service cloud hosted that allows you to issue those identifiers to your users and your organization."</p><p>The unveiling of MicroStrategy Orange marks a new milestone in the integration of Bitcoin into enterprise solutions. This platform is designed to empower organizations to use and manage decentralized identity applications utilizing the Bitcoin blockchain, leveraging its robust security and immutability features.</p><p>Raczko further explained that this new innovation allows you to deploy prepackaged applications that runs on the MicroStrategy Orange platform. "The orange apps are what's going to be prepackaged, point solutions that address specific digital identify challenges," he said.</p><p>"We see a huge opportunity and this is just the beginning," the MicroStrategy EVP of Engineering said. "Custodial or non-custodial, the obvious thing is every Bitcoin wallet out there should incorporate the capability of creating a Bitcoin based digital identity. Many messaging platforms suffer from the same challenges that email does. When you get a text message, how do you know the person who sent you the text message...We would want to include an orange check for these different messaging platforms." </p><figure> <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA2MTM3MzAyOTk1NDQ0OTI1/screenshot-2024-05-01-at-62810pm.png" height="663" width="1200"> </figure> <p>"And the other opportunity we see and we want to pursue is integrating the digital identity based on Bitcoin with this bigger verifiable credential ecosystem which opens up another large number of very interesting use cases," Raczko concluded. "Where I can now credential my identity anchored to Bitcoin — with a university degree, with a course certification issued by a hyperscaler, with your medical record and present those and have those verified all in a decentralized way. But with the ultimate identity living and being anchored to the Bitcoin blockchain."</p><p>Earlier this year in February, MicroStrategy <a href="https://x.com/BitcoinMagazine/status/1755359921699205578">announced</a> itself as "the world's first Bitcoin development company" during a presentation. Since then, MicroStrategy Orange has been the first technological innovation involving Bitcoin that the business intelligence and software company has announced.</p><p>The full announcement of MicroStrategy Orange can be viewed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXQWj6P0P1k">here</a>.</p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nXQWj6P0P1k" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe> ]]>

<![CDATA[ <p><strong>Company Name:</strong> DEMAND</p><p><strong>Founders:</strong> Alejandro De La Torre and Filippo Merli</p><p><strong>Date Founded:</strong> 2023</p><p><strong>Location of Headquarters:</strong> Lisbon, Portugal and Florence, Italy</p><p><strong>Amount of Bitcoin in Treasury:</strong> “Currently being bootstrapped”</p><p><strong>Number of Employees:</strong> 2</p><p><strong>Website:</strong> <a href="https://www.dmnd.work/">https://www.dmnd.work/</a></p><p><strong>Public or Private?</strong> Private</p><p>Alejandro De La Torre is deeply concerned that Bitcoin mining is too centralized, and he’s on a mission to change that. This is why he started <a href="https://www.dmnd.work/">DEMAND</a>, a Bitcoin mining pool that puts power back in the hands of independent Bitcoin miners.</p><p>Before getting into how DEMAND works, though, it’s important to understand what De La Torre has learned from his time in the Bitcoin mining industry so as to better understand his motivation in starting DEMAND.</p><h2>De La Torre’s History In The Bitcoin Mining Space</h2><p>De La Torre has served as the VP of <a href="https://www.poolin.com/">Poolin</a>, one of the largest Bitcoin and crypto mining pools in the world, as well as the VP of Business Operations for <a href="http://btc.com">BTC.com</a>, which also operated its own Bitcoin mining pool. What he saw during his time in these two roles made him realize that there was little time to waste in decentralizing the Bitcoin mining landscape.</p><p>“The experience I had in the last pools made me realize that we needed a change in the mining pool industry and we needed it very, very quickly,” De La Torre told Bitcoin Magazine. “There's a very clear problem with centralization in mining pools today, and I was able to pinpoint that issue while working at BTC.com and Poolin.”</p><p>De La Torre went on to describe how many Bitcoin mining pools are now proxies for a larger pool, which he didn’t mention by name (it’s <a href="https://theminermag.com/news/2023-12-28/bitcoin-mining-pool-block-reward-antpool-hashrate/">Antpool</a>), and explained that such centralization has the power to seriously damage Bitcoin.</p><p>“The anchor pool is close to 50% of the network now. It allows for a 51% attack on the network, which would be catastrophic,” said De La Torre.</p><p>“I don’t think they would ever do it, but the possibility is there, which is already a huge red flag,” he added.</p><p>De La Torre also pointed out that such levels of centralization pose risks when it comes to network censorship, highlighting that it wouldn’t be difficult for this major pool to censor half of the transactions on the Bitcoin network.</p><p>The potential for censorship and a 51% attack “are a very clear and present danger that we have in Bitcoin right now,” according to De La Torre.</p><h2>Power To The Solo Miners</h2><p>In reaction to this, De La Torre and his business partner, Filippo Merli, <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/demand-launches-worlds-first-stratum-v2-bitcoin-mining-pool">launched DEMAND Pool</a> in November 2023 with the intention of putting the power back in the hands of solo miners.</p><p>DEMAND is the world’s first<a href="https://stratumprotocol.org/"> Stratum V2</a> mining pool. Stratum V2 is an open-source messaging protocol that enables miners and pools to communicate directly with each other, reducing mining infrastructure requirements compared to its previous iteration, and enabling solo miners to choose their own mining templates.</p><p>“Pools today are the ones who are in charge of building the blocks and adding the transactions into the blocks,” said De La Torre. “With Stratum V2 — with DEMAND — the miners themselves will be able to build the blocks and add the transactions that they want.”</p><p>Most filtering in mining pools today is done at the pool level, not the individual miner level. De La Torre understands that, especially in the wake of the introductions of protocols like Ordinals and Runes, miners want more control over what types of transactions they include in their blocks. And De La Torre believes miners should have this power, because it adds to the ethos of decentralization. He also added that DEMAND will accept any blocks sent to the pool.</p><p>“This gives me less power. That's what I want. I don't want the power. I'm done with that power,” said De La Torre. “I've had it before, and it's too much power in the hands of too few. And that's not what Bitcoin is. Bitcoin is decentralization, and this is furthering that.”</p><h2>Incentivizing Solo Miners</h2><p>De La Torre is aware that the odds of mining a block are against small-scale solo miners, but he doesn’t think they shouldn’t give finding one a shot, and he’s also created other ways to incentivize solo miners to come online.</p><p>“You’ve got to heat up your home during winter, right? Why not just use a Bitcoin miner as a heater?” said De La Torre.</p><p>“If you’re lucky, you hit a block and you just made your wife very happy,” he added with a laugh.</p><p>Solo miners who join DEMAND Pool will also have the option to sell the hash rate they produce on a marketplace, ensuring that they receive some income for their efforts. DEMAND has set up a deal with the hash rate marketplace <a href="https://rigly.io/">Rigly</a> and plans to establish more partnerships.</p><p>De La Torre also touched on how DEMAND payments will be done via the PPLNS (Pay Per Last N Share) system. With PPLNS, profits are allocated based on the number blocks a mining pool mines per day and payouts fluctuate based on the pool’s luck in mining blocks.</p><p>This system differs from the FPPS (Full Pay Per Share) system, which is commonly used in the major mining pools. With FPPS, the mining service charge and block reward are settled based on theoretical profit, and miners get paid whether the pool finds a block or not.</p><p>De La Torre is aware that it may sound attractive to miners to get paid consistently with FPPS, but he was quick to point out that payouts through both PPLNS and FPPS are comparable over the long term.</p><p>“A lot of people have some misunderstandings about PPLNS,” said De La Torre.</p><p>“FPPS gives you constant payouts, which is fine. I understand why a miner would find FPPS. However, PPLNS over enough time averages out to about the same,” he added. </p><p>“Yes, you won't have constant payouts, but you will have incorrect payouts according to how much hash rate DEMAND has — and we intend to have a good amount. You will still be getting a constant payout, or it would average out to more or less the same. So, there's no real downside to it.”</p><p>De La Torre also pointed out that solo mining as part of DEMAND’s pool is one of the best ways for Bitcoin enthusiasts to get their hands on non-KYC bitcoin.</p><p>He also stressed the fact that solo miners’ coming online will do something else that’s vital to keeping Bitcoin decentralized — it will bring more nodes online.</p><h2>Send Nodes</h2><p>To use DEMAND’s block templates, miners have to run their own nodes. This means that solo miners would not only contribute to the decentralization of Bitcoin’s hash rate but also to the decentralization of its governance.</p><p>“Not only do we want the solo community and the home mining community to flourish and to make more money, but we also want node proliferation,” said De La Torre.</p><p>“Solo miners will provide hash rate to secure the network and potentially make some bitcoin and also help with maintaining Bitcoin Core or whatever Bitcoin client they want. Nodes are good for the health of the system,” he added.</p><h2>Looking Ahead</h2><p>De La Torre also said that DEMAND is currently working on expanding its services to pooled mining, and that DEMAND will actively be looking for miners to come on board.</p><p>He’s vowed to make DEMAND a “stable and trustworthy pool with transparent payouts,” differentiating it from the “black box” pools out there.</p><p>De La Torre seems to be doing everything in his power to bring more independent miners online, and as he laid out his plans for DEMAND in my conversation with him, there was a palpable sense of urgency in his voice.</p><p>“The centralization of Bitcoin mining pools is becoming a very serious issue, and it's up to us as the mining community to do something about it,” said De La Torre. “If we don’t, it’s not good.”</p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ <p>Is OP_CAT happening? The covenants proposal was just assigned BIP number #347. But before we delve deeper, let’s explore what covenants are and why Bitcoiners may want them.</p><p>Is Bitcoin an ideal state of digital e-cash or do we want more from our coins on-chain?</p><h2>Scratching the Surface: Bitcoin Scripts Limitations</h2><p>To understand covenant proposals like OP_CAT, it's crucial to grok the fundamental limitations of Bitcoin Script as it is today. Under the hood, Bitcoin allows for the creation of basic smart contracts through codes that define the rules for locking and unlocking funds. However, Bitcoin Script, as a programming language, is fairly limited to basic logic that comes into play only when moving coins in a new transaction.</p><p><em>In Bitcoin today there is no way to pre-configure or dictate your coins' transaction paths, or how fast coins can move at the time they’re being locked up (aside from hacky workflows using PSBT, partially signed bitcoin transactions, which cannot properly include transaction fees, prove deletion if unused, or prevent broadcasting later).</em></p><p>This simplicity, while core to Bitcoin's security model, introduces significant limitations in the scripting language’s ability to support even basic smart contracts.</p><h2>Linear Execution Model</h2><p>One limitation of Bitcoin Script is its operational model where opcodes are executed sequentially with no loops.</p><figure> <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA2MTI3NzIyMjY1NTg0ODI5/script.png" height="267" width="1200"> </figure> <p>From this example of a P2PKH transaction, you can see how the script executes linearly: duplicating the public key, hashing it to an address, verifying the hash against the lock script, and finally checking the signature against the public key.</p><p>The absence of looping means that scripts are not Turing complete and are guaranteed to terminate, preventing issues like infinite loops that could potentially halt or significantly slow down the network. While this design choice allows resource usage to be statically bounded, it also limits Script’s capability to manage complex workflows.</p><h2>Lack of Basic Arithmetic</h2><p>Bitcoin Script has just under 100 nontrivial opcodes, and somewhat surprisingly there is no ability to multiply, divide, or combine objects on the stack. As many users interested in OP_CAT will know, Satoshi <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/4bd188c4383d6e614e18f79dc337fbabe8464c82">disabled several opcodes in Bitcoin in 2010</a>, including OP_OR, OP_MUL (multiply), OP_DIV (divide), and OP_CAT (concatenate) among others. The disabled opcodes were removed because their original implementations had exploitable vulnerabilities that could compromise the network's security. But the absence of these opcodes makes it difficult to do basic math, which could be useful in simple scenarios like calculating transaction fees in a contract.</p><h2>Lack of Transaction Data Visibility</h2><p>Superficially, I think most people assume that Bitcoin smart contracts are able to see value amounts and any other parts of transaction data, since this information is already publicly viewable on the blockchain. But contrary to this assumption, contracts on Bitcoin are not able to set spend conditions based on transaction data, because Bitcoin Script has a very limited ability to see into transaction data at all.</p><p>If script had the ability to interpret more details within transaction data, we could build much more robust contracts that could do all the fun things like enforce specific spending conditions, create multi-stage transactions, and enable more advanced security features like vaults.</p><h2>What do we do about it?</h2><p>We know Bitcoin has these limitations, and over the years many different proposals have been discussed to introduce (or in some cases reintroduce) this functionality. Broader experiments with Bitcoin Script, such as Simplicity and others, aim to provide an alternative to stack-based constraints. Opcodes like OP_MULTISHA256, OP_LESS, and OP_LE32TOLE64 aim to upgrade Bitcoin's arithmetic abilities. Proposals like OP_CTV and OP_CAT that deal with <a href="https://glossary.blockstream.com/introspection-opcodes/">introspection opcodes</a> are grouped under the term covenants.</p><p>So what exactly is the difference between smart contracts and new term covenants?</p><h3>Smart Contracts vs. Covenants</h3><p>Smart contracts are self-executing transactions that transfer funds without intermediaries. In Bitcoin today, the smart contracts are limited to the act of locking and unlocking bitcoin with Bitcoin Script. Covenants aim to enhance Bitcoin's smart contracts functionality by enabling users to control how their funds are spent in future transactions.</p><p>By enabling Script to interpret transaction data, we effectively create a way for that data to be used in contract logic.</p><p>These are just some of the more interesting introspection opcodes for covenants functionality:</p><ol><li>OP_TXHASH: Provides the hash of a transaction’s inputs (or outputs), and gives Script the ability to verify and enforce conditions based on transaction data.</li><li>OP_CSFS + OP_CAT: The two together allow scripts to check signatures against any data, not just the transaction itself. This means Script can verify conditions based on transaction data or external information, expanding the possibilities for validation within Bitcoin scripts.</li></ol><p>These two opcodes are intentionally broad, enabling complex validation processes and introspection capabilities. Others are more narrow in scope and are designed to be a more limited form of covenants.</p><ol><li>OP_CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY (CTV): Allows a transaction output to embed a template of a future spending transaction, enabling covenants in a more constrained way.</li><li>OP_VAULT: Enables a specific form of covenant used for “vaulting”, which lets users specify a transaction destination but not actually move coins except after a delay.</li></ol><p>Then there is OP_CAT on its own, which is not directly an introspection opcode…</p><ol><li>OP_CAT: Enables Script to concatenate two elements on the stack, which is useful for combining different pieces of information within a script.</li></ol><p>OP_CAT doesn’t seem to have any introspection abilities, so what’s going on here?</p><h2>OP_CAT: Unraveling All of the Possibilities</h2><h3>Transaction Introspection</h3><p>In 2021, Andrew Poelstra wrote about <a href="https://blog.blockstream.com/cat-and-schnorr-tricks-i/">OP_CAT introspection tricks in a blog post</a>. He provided specific examples but presumed readers had prior knowledge of similar techniques. Here, I'll aim to simplify that explanation for better understanding.</p><p>In Bitcoin Script, there are only three primary opcodes that allow you to introspect the transaction data: CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY, CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY, and CHECKSIG. Additionally, there are variants like CHECKSIGVERIFY, CHECKSIGADD, CHECKMULTISIG, and CHECKMULTISIGVERIFY, which are essentially minor variations of CHECKSIG. The first two only let you see if the check is verified, providing a fairly narrow functionality. CHECKSIG is similar, but the difference here is that it allows you to grab the signature and the public key on the stack. Interesting.</p><p>Traditionally, we think of concatenation as a function that joins two items together, but we can also use it to separate or split an item, in this case—the signature into an (r, s) pair.</p><p>How do we derive OP_SPLIT functionality from OP_CAT?</p><blockquote><p>“If you have some big object you can split it into two by asking the user to spend time to provide the two pieces. You CAT them together and check equality basically. You can always invert every operation this way. With CAT by itself you can break apart signatures.” — Andrew Poelstra, <a href="https://btctranscripts.com/tabconf/2021/2021-11-05-jeremy-rubin-andrew-poelstra-covenants/">TABConf 2021</a></p></blockquote><p>What is happening here?</p><p>By requiring the user to provide the signature, public key, and transaction, you can split the signature into its component parts, then checking each part independently against the transaction data. This technique can be viewed as a form of splitting or combining, as it validates that the signature and public key are indeed the components of a valid transaction.</p><p>How does all this get us introspection?</p><blockquote><p>“In Taproot where we have Schnorr signatures using OP_CAT and the Schnorr signature verification opcode it turns out that it is possible to get a form of non-recursive covenant where you literally get a transaction hash. Not even like a funny mangled transaction hash but a literal SHA2 hash of all the transaction data onto the stack.” — Andrew Poelstra, <a href="https://btctranscripts.com/tabconf/2021/2021-11-05-jeremy-rubin-andrew-poelstra-covenants/">TABConf 2021</a></p></blockquote><p>Poelstra goes on to demonstrate how you can get a SHA2 hash for transaction inputs or outputs left on the stack. We’ll skip the moon math here, but the implication is that with OP_CAT we can constrain parts of a transaction as a requirement of the unlocking script. We can constrain the send address or value being sent of that transaction, where the transaction hash serves as the key to unlock it.</p><h4>Vaults</h4><p>Using the same techniques give us transaction introspection and quickly give us a basic version of vaults. Following the logic outlined in Poelstra’s blog, a developer by the name of Rijndael proved that we can do this with OP_CAT alone in his implementation of <a href="https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/basic-vault-prototype-using-op-cat/576">Purrfect Vaults</a>.</p><blockquote><p>“Re-building a TXID on the stack to introspect previous transactions was actually easier than I expected.” — Rijndael</p></blockquote><p>With vaults, users specify the next address that their funds must go to, providing mechanisms for fund recovery in case of key compromise, and reducing the incentive for private key theft.</p><h4>Merkle Trees for Script</h4><p>In Bitcoin today, Merkle Trees are the data structure used for data verification, synchronization, and more or less ‘chaining’ the blockchain's transactions and blocks together. The OP_CAT opcode, which enables the concatenation of two stack variables, when used alongside SHA256 hashes of public keys, facilitates a straightforward Merkle tree verification process for scripts. This approach, initially proposed by Pieter Wuille in 2015, was successfully implemented in the Liquid network.</p><p>Imagine a tree structure brimming with various spending conditions, such as hash preimages, timelocks, and public keys, known as tree signatures.</p><h4>Tree Signatures</h4><p>OP_CAT enables the creation of Tree Signatures which:</p><blockquote><p>“...Provide a multisignature script whose size can be logarithmic in the number of public keys and can encode spend conditions beyond n-of-m. For instance, a transaction less than 1KB in size could support tree signatures with a thousand public keys. This also enables generalized logical spend conditions.” — BIP author Ethan Heilman, on the <a href="https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2023-October/022049.html">bitcoin-dev mailing list</a></p></blockquote><p>This would enable the validation of any hashed content within the tree, maintaining data integrity and trustworthiness without adding unnecessary bulk or bloat to the blockchain.</p><p>What is interesting about all of this?</p><h3>Recursive Covenants</h3><p>If you have the ability to examine a transaction and apply constraints to certain parts of it, you can set up conditions that carry over through multiple transactions, effectively creating a chain of ongoing restrictions. This concept is called a recursive covenant. OP_CAT is a unique proposal because it gives us so much power for just 10 new lines of code. It has the ability to address all three of the initial limitations we covered at the onset of the post: transaction data visibility, better math functionality, and its linear execution model.</p><p>While OP_CAT may seem straightforward at first, it unlocks significant potential when leveraged creatively. It serves as a building block for even more functionality way beyond the scope of this discussion, like Post-Quantum Lamport Signatures.</p><h4>Is This Safe?</h4><p>Before OP_CAT was initially removed, when combined with OP_DUP (duplicate), and used repetitively to duplicate an initially-1-byte value on the stack, memory usage could be made to explode. This could have been used as a denial-of-service (DoS) attack as a result of increased memory consumption. The new proposal trivially prevents this attack by imposing a 520-byte limit on stack elements.</p><p>Is there a danger of a contract running forever?</p><p>If by this we mean, does OP_CAT change the execution model of Script to mean that it no longer statically bounds its resource usage (as a linear function of the Script size)? No.</p><p>Would covenants create a market for other coins on top of Bitcoin?</p><p>If you have a recursive covenant, yes, you can technically build up complex layer-2 applications, including NFTs, decentralized exchanges, and quantum cats. However, doing so is not trivial. It’s hard to see any serious markets do so.</p><p>Can you permanently "taint" coins by using CAT?</p><p>In the case of colored coins and NFTs, issuing these assets the user effectively 'burns' a satoshi, marking it in a way that signifies ownership of the ‘layer-2’ asset. This process is known as 'tainting' coins. But only the owner of a coin can mark their coin, and Bitcoin wallets will no longer recognize it (unless their authors explicitly add code to enable this). The resulting coins would not be accepted by bitcoin wallets. Probably they would be accepted by cryptocat wallets or something like that, but this is irrelevant to most bitcoin users.</p><p>Would this create an MEV problem on Bitcoin?</p><p>A key point of distinction between Bitcoin and Ethereum is transaction visibility. Unlike Ethereum, not all aspects of the contract are necessarily transparent, meaning that Bitcoin miners don’t have the same ability to see internal contract state and front-run them.</p><p>The main concern of OP_CAT by economically minded Bitcoiners is the potential for Miner Extractable Value (MEV). As discussed more extensively in my <a href="https://blog.blockstream.com/miner-extractable-value-mev-and-programmable-money-the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly/">previous post on the subject</a>. Many users are concerned that if we make layer-2 contracts technically possible, MEV will become inevitable. But is this true? Specifically, does the technical feasibility of layer-2 coins on Bitcoin imply their inevitable creation and adoption?</p><p>You could imagine building simple swap contracts or comparatively inefficient NFTs, but building up something as complex as DEXs with automatic market makers seems extremely unlikely and is not ever something we’ve seen on Liquid despite the ‘technical possibility’ for it.</p><h2>So is OP_CAT really perfect?</h2><p>Hardly, far from it. Some folks would love to see recursive covenants, while others simply don’t want to see Bitcoin change at all.</p><p>A faction of Bitcoiners, "ossificationists", advocate for preserving Bitcoin in its current state and view any protocol upgrades with skepticism. They are particularly concerned that significant changes, like the introduction of covenants, could undermine the network's decentralization. Their argument hinges on the belief that it's best to stick closely to Bitcoin's original vision. The irony being that OP_CAT was initially part of Bitcoin, fuels a counterargument. Some believe that bringing OP_CAT back could actually realign Bitcoin with Satoshi's initial vision.</p><p>If you'd like to see some of the security features that recursive covenants could make possible, OP_CAT would be nice, but definitely not as nice as a full-blown Lisp-esque scripting language. The problem here being that this would be a massive change to Bitcoin, that’s not likely to find its footing anytime soon.</p><p>Or maybe, you're on the other end, and you’d prefer the simplicity of non-recursive like OP_CTV or OP_VAULT. Non-recursive covenants are simpler and easier to reason about, without the risk of creating an uncontrolled chain of constraints.</p><p>What if some version of recursive covenants were inevitable?</p><p>Over the years, developers have noticed that almost any extension to the transaction validation logic could be used to emulate the functionality of OP_CAT.</p><p>In the Script universe, there are two realms, based on the size of the stack elements. For stack elements larger than 4 bytes, you can compare for equality, interpret as a key a signature, or hash it. For stack elements less than or equal to 4 bytes, you can treat them as objects to do arithmetic or branching. With a RISC-V processor running on a BitVM, you can do literally anything. Anything that allows you to emulate OP_CAT, break stack elements up, or concatenate them together brings these two realms together, so that you can ‘do anything’ with Script.</p><p>Researchers like Andrew Poelstra expect we could do recursive covenants with pretty much any new opcode. If true, that would be a justification for working towards a way to do them well.</p><p>Is OP_CAT the likely path forward for covenants?</p><p>If covenants are not just interesting, but inevitable, how do we ensure it's implemented in such a way that gets more Bitcoin users sending trustlessly like Satoshi originally envisioned? While ossificationists remain divided, still OP_CAT continues to ascend as a strong contender in the covenants debate.</p><p>OP_CAT is not the most elegant chisel, but it's one with the best ratio of power to complexity, that would allow developers to carve up some amazing new features.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Kiara Bickers.

<![CDATA[ <p><a href="https://www.hoseki.app/">Hoseki</a>, a leader in Bitcoin and blockchain verification solutions, has unveiled Hoseki Verified, a new verification product aimed at enhancing transparency and trust in the cryptocurrency industry, with a focus on spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) asset verification, according to a press release sent to Bitcoin Magazine.</p><p>This public dashboard aims to set a new industry standard for verification, offering both retail and institutional investors full visibility into the BTC holdings of these funds.</p><figure> <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA2MTA5MjczNTAyMDAwMzE3/unnamed-16.jpg" height="675" width="1200"> <figcaption>Image via press release</figcaption> </figure> <p><a href="https://www.hoseki.app/verified">Hoseki Verified</a> intends to provide real-time verification of bitcoin held in custody by spot Bitcoin ETF issuers and other financial institutions. The public dashboard, accessible to all, displays verified bitcoin holdings with custodians such as Coinbase, BitGo, and Gemini, according to the release, offering a level of transparency previously unavailable in the industry.</p><p>“In the world of institutional investing, transparency isn't just a value-add; it's a fundamental necessity,” said Hoseki CEO Sam Abbassi. “As the crypto market matures, investors demand higher standards of clarity and accountability. Hoseki Verified meets this need by providing an unwavering level of digital asset verification, ensuring that every Spot Bitcoin ETF adheres to the highest standards of transparency and integrity.”</p><p>Asset management firm and spot Bitcoin ETF issuer <a href="https://bitbetf.com/">Bitwise (BITB)</a>, has embraced this initiative as the first participant. In January, Bitwise first provided transparency regarding its Bitcoin ETF when it <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/bitwise-becomes-first-u-s-spot-bitcoin-etf-to-disclose-btc-holding-addresses">published</a> the bitcoin addresses of its ETF holdings, taking lead in setting a new precedent for asset transparency amongst the ETF issuers. By partnering with Hoseki Verified, Bitwise is reinforcing its dedication to investor confidence and security.</p><p>“We deeply care about Bitcoin and its core value propositions, amongst them being audibility and public transparency, which is why we’ve taken the initiative in being public about our on-chain assets and why we are thrilled to be working with Hoseki to make the public transparency work we’ve already done even more robust,” explained Bitwise CTO Hong Kim.</p><p>Hoseki Verified is not just limited to Bitwise; it welcomes and invites other entities in Bitcoin to join this initiative to create a more transparent Bitcoin investment landscape. With Hoseki Verified, investors can verify the integrity and transparency of these investment vehicles, ultimately contributing to a healthier and more trustworthy financial ecosystem.</p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ <p>Major global bank Standard Chartered believes the Bitcoin price could see further downside to around $50,000, according to recent comments. </p><p>Geoffrey Kendrick, head of forex and digital assets research at Standard Chartered, told <a href="https://www.theblock.co/post/291908/standard-chartered-bitcoin-price-fall-50000">The Block</a>: "BTC's proper break below $60,000 has now reopened a route to the $50,000-52,000 range."</p><p>As of writing, Bitcoin is trading under $57,000 after a steep drawdown from recent highs above $70,000. Kendrick cited both the Bitcoin market and broader macroeconomic factors weighing on Bitcoin's price.</p><p>He highlighted five straight days of outflows from <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/tags/bitcoin-etf">U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs</a> and the slow start for new Hong Kong spot Bitcoin ETFs as the reasons for the recent drawdown.</p><p>Beyond markets, Kendrick pointed to deteriorating liquidity measures in the U.S. that have put pressure on risk assets like Bitcoin.</p><p>However, Standard Chartered and Kendrick maintain a bullish long-term outlook. The bank <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/150000-standard-chartered-bitcoin-price-forecast-2024">recently raised</a> its 2024 year-end Bitcoin price target to $150,000 and sees prices potentially reaching $250,000 in 2025. </p><p>Kendrick stated the bank's forecast remains intact, expecting the next rally to come after the 2024 U.S. elections.</p><p>Negative sentiment stemming from the recent arrests of Binance founder Changpeng Zhao (CZ) and early <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/legal/doj-arrests-early-bitcoin-investor-roger-ver-bitcoin-jesus-on-charges-of-tax-fraud">Bitcoin investor Roger Ver</a> could also be factors in the drawdown. </p><figure> <a href="https://bm.b.tc/unchained-bmag-dot-com" ><img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA0MzE5MTg5MTE1NDc5NDkz/bm-x-unchained-article-cta---learn-more.png" height="507" width="1200"></a> <figcaption><em>Click the image to learn more.</em></figcaption> </figure> <p>Still, the pullback also comes after Bitcoin posted seven straight months of gains, signaling a potential need for consolidation.</p><p>However, mainstream adoption continues accelerating, as seen in the massive early inflows into U.S. spot ETFs. And while Hong Kong ETF trading began slowly, these investment vehicles should unlock significant institutional demand over time.</p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ <p>Roger Ver, a prominent early investor in Bitcoin and famously dubbed “Bitcoin Jesus,” has been indicted by the Department of Justice (DOJ) on charges of mail fraud, tax evasion, and filing false tax returns. Ver was arrested over the weekend in Spain based on these criminal charges, and the U.S. intends to seek his extradition for trial.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">JUST IN: 🇺🇸 US DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE ARRESTS EARLY <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/BITCOIN?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#BITCOIN</a> INVESTOR ROGER VER, CHARGED WITH TAX EVASION <a href="https://t.co/KdShrow0PS">pic.twitter.com/KdShrow0PS</a></p>&mdash; Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) <a href="https://twitter.com/BitcoinMagazine/status/1785379846425616800?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 30, 2024</a></blockquote> <script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> <p>The indictment alleges that Ver, formerly of Santa Clara, California, owned and operated MemoryDealers.com Inc. and Agilestar.com Inc., both of which were involved in selling computer and networking equipment. Starting in 2011, Ver purportedly began acquiring bitcoins for himself and his companies, amassing a significant amount by 2014, totaling around 131,000 bitcoins with a value of approximately $240 million.</p><p>Ver then obtained citizenship in St. Kitts and Nevis in 2014 and renounced his U.S. citizenship shortly thereafter, in a process known as expatriation. This action subjected him to U.S. tax laws, including reporting capital gains from the sale of his worldwide assets, including bitcoins, and paying an “exit tax” on those gains.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/early-bitcoin-investor-charged-tax-fraud">indictment</a> alleges that Ver provided false or misleading information to a law firm and an appraiser, concealing the true number of bitcoins owned by him and his companies. This resulted in the preparation and filing of false tax returns that significantly undervalued the companies and their bitcoin holdings.</p><p>By 2017, Ver’s companies still held approximately 70,000 bitcoins, which he allegedly sold on cryptocurrency exchanges for around $240 million. Despite not being a U.S. citizen at the time, Ver was still legally obligated to report to the IRS and pay taxes on certain distributions, which he allegedly failed to do, causing a loss to the IRS estimated at over $48 million, the indictment stated.</p><p>Acting Deputy Assistant Attorney General Stuart M. Goldberg and U.S. Attorney Martin Estrada announced the charges, with IRS Criminal Investigation's cybercrimes unit handling the case. An indictment is an allegation, and all defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty in court.</p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ <p>JPMorgan Chase, the largest bank in America, has <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/19617/000001961724000369/0000019617-24-000369.txt">revealed</a> exposure to spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) in a newly filed document with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) today.</p><figure> <a href="https://x.com/PhoenixTrades_/status/1789018590206669258" ><img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA2MzQyNjU5NjA5NDA1MTM0/download-42.png" height="342" width="1200"></a> <figcaption><p><a href="https://x.com/PhoenixTrades_/status/1789018590206669258">Phoenix Trades</a></p></figcaption> </figure> <p>The SEC filing by JPMorgan Chase provides specific insights into the bank's exposure to spot Bitcoin ETFs. The bank currently has exposure to spot Bitcoin ETFs issued by some of the largest asset managers in the world: BlackRock, Fidelity, Grayscale, and more.</p><p>Though, the amount of money allocated to each ETF seems a bit underwhelming, taking into consideration how much money other institutions are allocating to purchasing Bitcoin. That's because:</p><p>"JPM, Susquehanna (which also owns these ETFs and was all over this site last week) and others are just market makers and/or AP's. Their ownership isn't necessarily indicative of anything other than this is how many shares they had on 3/31/24," <a href="https://x.com/JSeyff/status/1789026505013506157">commented</a> Bloomberg ETF Analyst James Seyffart. "If you're making markets in these things, the number of shares held could swing heavily day to day. The 13F data is simply a snapshot of *LONG* positions held on 3/31 13F's don't show shorts OR derivatives. So we don't even have a full look at their true exposure on 3/31."</p><p>Bloomberg Senior ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas also commented on the news, <a href="https://x.com/EricBalchunas/status/1789026897852047366">stating</a> we'll "prob[ably] see many of the big banks report some holdings in their role as market makers/APs. That is dif[ferent from] them buying for the exposure (and thus less hypocritical in JPM's case).. props for catching this tho we still working on getting the file on bbg it just came out."</p><p>"What is notable IMO is the sheer number of holders that each has so far. $IBIT is up to 250. That's bonkers for first quarter on market," Balchunas <a href="https://x.com/EricBalchunas/status/1789027843449512147">continued</a>. "Here's comparison of the other ETFs launched same week-ish as btc ones. And we still have like a week of 13Fs to roll in yet."</p><figure> <a href="https://x.com/EricBalchunas/status/1789027843449512147" ><img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA2MzQzMjI5MjI4OTg0MDE0/gnpnjmgxaaeenql.png" height="800" width="1065"></a> <figcaption><p><a href="https://x.com/EricBalchunas/status/1789027843449512147">Eric Balchunas</a></p></figcaption> </figure> <p>JPMorgan's disclosure comes just hours after Wells Fargo, America's third largest bank, also made a similar <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/wells-fargo-americas-third-largest-bank-owns-spot-bitcoin-etfs-sec-filing">revelation</a> about its spot Bitcoin ETF exposure.</p><figure> <a href="https://bm.b.tc/unchained-bmag-dot-com" ><img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA2MzM4Njk1MDg1Njk2NzE4/unnamed-40.png" height="506" width="1200"></a> <figcaption><em>Click the image to learn more.</em></figcaption> </figure> ]]>

<![CDATA[ <p><strong><em>The below is an excerpt from a recent edition of Bitcoin Magazine Pro, Bitcoin Magazine's premium markets newsletter. To be among the first to receive these insights and other on-chain bitcoin market analysis straight to your inbox, </em></strong><strong><em><a href="https://bmpro.substack.com/">subscribe now</a>.</em></strong></p><figure> <a href="https://bmpro.substack.com/" ><img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjAxMjU3OTE4Njk0MTcyMTYx/mtg5njayntyzmtmymjm2ode4.jpg" height="246" width="1200"></a> </figure> <p>Modern Monetary Theory (MMT) is back in the spotlight, driven by a new film <em><a href="https://findingmoneyfilm.com/">Finding the Money</a></em> and a <a href="https://x.com/FindingMoneyDoc/status/1786050601236779078">recent clip</a> that went viral on Bitcoin Twitter and Fintwit. In the clip, Jared Bernstein, Chair of the Council of Economic Advisors to the US President, is seen not being able to describe the most basic concepts of government debt and money printing. He claims MMT is correct but some of the language and concepts (the most basic ones) are confusing to him. An absolutely shocking statement given his role. </p><p>In this post, I will outline several major flaws in MMT that perhaps you, dear reader, will be able to use to go forth and debunk MMT. The stakes are high, because MMT cultists are gaining positions of power in governments around the world, as exemplified by Mr. Bernstein. It is a very dangerous proposition to put these people in power, because they will rapidly destroy the currency and cause economic armageddon. As bitcoiners, we believe bitcoin will replace the credit-based dollar, but we want the transition to be natural and relatively uneventful. A collapse of a major currency without bitcoin being ready to take the reins, would be catastrophic for so many. </p><h2>Introduction to MMT</h2><p>Modern Monetary Theory (MMT) is a post-Keynesian macroeconomic framework asserting that fiscal deficits are essentially inconsequential, monetary policy should be subordinate to fiscal policy, and monetary authorities ought to issue base money to finance massive government programs. MMT promises to eliminate involuntary unemployment and address social issues such as poverty and climate change. MMT is rooted in the belief that all money is a creation of the State, engineered through legal frameworks to facilitate governmental control over economic activities.</p><p>According to MMT, the government, which can issue its currency at will, cannot go bankrupt. However, there are obvious limitations to this power, like the inability to control the currency's value. MMT also redefines the traditional functions of money—medium of exchange, store of value, and unit of account—asserting that these functions are mere byproducts of government policy rather than intrinsic properties like scarcity and divisibility. This theory leads to the controversial notion that a government could dictate any item as money—be it acorns, IOUs, or Bitcoin—solely based on legal declarations, disregarding their properties, a concept starkly at odds with real-world economic dynamics.</p><h2>No Coherent Theory of Value</h2><p>The most significant shortcomings of Modern Monetary Theory is its approach to the theory of value. Instead of a subjective theory of value, where prices emerge through the preferences of individual actors, like personal spending or saving decisions, MMT replaces this with a democratic or collective theory of value.</p><p>According to MMT, the value of money is not derived from its utility in monetary functions—such as a medium of exchange, a store of value, or a unit of account. Instead, in MMT money's value originates from the collective acceptance and trust in the state that issues it. This acceptance then supposedly confers value onto the money. In other words, MMT reverses the traditional understanding: it is not that something valuable becomes accepted as money, but that something becomes valuable because of forced acceptance as money.</p><p>The value of money is reliant on the State being the economic calculator of sorts, instead of the individual market actors. The aggregate preferences of society along with central planning expertise go into an equation and full-employment is the result. This is not a joke. They don't have a theory of value beyond what was just explained.</p><h2>The Mechanics of MMT: Taxes and Fiscal Policy</h2><p>Modern Monetary Theory presents a skewed understanding of fiscal policy and taxation, proposing that taxes serve as the base load of demand for state-issued money. Without taxes, MMT adherents argue, government spending would lead to devaluation. This point reveals a notable contradiction: while MMT devotees fervently deny that deficits matter at all, they simultaneously argue that taxes are essential to counteract deficits’ adverse effects.</p><figure> <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA2MzM2OTgxNjYyMTgxMDcw/f9f9c23a-017e-4323-b590-378bdd98a032_1527x786.jpg" height="617" width="1200"> <figcaption><em>Source: <a href="https://www.marketplace.org/2019/01/24/modern-monetary-theory-explained/">MarketPlace</a></em></figcaption> </figure> <p>Furthermore, MMT believers overlook broader dynamics in currency markets. Taxes alone do not necessarily promote demand to hold a currency. Individuals may choose to minimize their holdings due to fears of depreciation, only converting other assets into cash when necessary to fulfill tax obligations. For example, a person might primarily operate using an alternative currency and only acquire the domestic currency in amounts needed to pay taxes.</p><p>In terms of fiscal policy, MMT contends the primary constraints on money printing are inflation, which in turn is due to the availability of real resources, such as labor and capital. In their school of thought, if they print money the result is economic growth until labor and capital are fully employed. Raising taxes is the mechanism to fight inflation by taking money out of the economy.</p><p>Another significant flaw in MMT is its required belief that the State can precisely manage fiscal policy outcomes. MMT overlooks the inherent limitations of central planning, particularly the circular reasoning that the information guiding fiscal policy is merely a reflection of previous government actions, assuming perfect policy transmission, without appreciation for real market data or external market dynamics. <strong>Are MMT planners in control or not? If so, it’s circular. If not, it’s wrong.</strong> </p><p>MMT does not acknowledge the existence of unintended consequences that necessitate frequent policy adjustments and undermine demand for the currency, because that would mean they aren’t in control. Moreover, market interest rates further complicate matters for MMT devotees. Micromanaging the economy would result in drastic declines in economic activity, lower demand for the currency and higher interest rates. Consequently, while MMT claims that the State can mandate the use of its currency, it does not have the power to control how the market values or trusts that currency.</p><h2>MMT and Resource Allocation</h2><p>MMT's approach to resource allocation emphasizes achieving "full employment" through top-down fiscal policies without addressing the efficiency of labor and capital use. Proponents of MMT argue that with the right fiscal policies, full employment of labor, capital, and resources can be guaranteed. However, they struggle to justify, using MMT principles, why seemingly unproductive activities like digging holes and then filling them back in are less beneficial than market derived employment of labor and capital. This often leads to ambiguous explanations about the differences in output, without a clear, consistent standard of value.</p><p>According to MMT, all economic activities that consume equal resources must be perceived as equally valuable, blurring the lines between productive investments and wasteful expenditures. For instance, there is no fundamental distinction made between using resources to build essential infrastructure or to construct "bridges to nowhere." This lack of an understanding of value leads to policies where the primary goal is employment rather than the value created by employment. The result is massive misallocation of labor and capital. </p><h2>Conclusion and Implications</h2><p>Modern Monetary Theory’s foundational principles and policy implications contain critical flaws. These range from its incoherent theory of value and reliance on circular fiscal policy logic, to its failure in competitive international currency markets and unworkable resource allocation strategies. Each of these risks could have profound consequences if MMT were widely implemented.</p><p>For those paying attention in the Bitcoin space, the similarities between MMT and Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) are particularly striking. CBDCs represent a shift from our current credit-based monetary system to a new form of fiat that can be tightly controlled through programmable policies—mirroring MMT's advocacy for pure fiat money managed by detailed fiscal policies. This alignment suggests that regions like Europe and China, which are advancing in CBDC implementation, may naturally gravitate towards MMT principles.</p><p><a href="https://substack.com/app/app-store-redirect?utm_campaign=app-marketing&utm_content=author-post-insert&utm_source=bmpro"></a></p><p>These transitions are monumental. A major economy cannot instantaneously switch to a new form of fiat money, despite what the MMT cultists would like you to think. The transition will span years, during which we'll likely witness the decline of traditional currencies. As MMT and these governments inadvertently champion Bitcoin, the choice for individuals, capital, and innovators will become clear. If people are forced to adopt a whole new form of money anyway, it will be a simple choice for capital, economic activity, and innovation to flee into Bitcoin.</p> ]]>

But what happens when you need to travel? If you hold large amounts of bitcoin in cold storage, should you carry the keys to your bitcoin wallet with you? And if you do travel with one or more keys, what steps do you need to take to stay secure?</p><p>Consider these seven tips for traveling with your bitcoin in a way that keeps you in control while minimizing risk.</p><h2>1. Carry only the wallets you need</h2><p>Bitcoin allows you to segregate funds into multiple wallets so you only need to carry the keys you need for smaller amounts of bitcoin. You can secure your bitcoin savings in cold storage multisig, while still carrying some sats in a hot wallet on your phone like <a href="https://bluewallet.io/">BlueWallet</a> or <a href="https://muun.com/">Muun</a>.</p><p>By only carrying keys to the wallets you need, you can spend and receive bitcoin while leaving the majority of your savings in a secure cold storage setup, such as multisig, that eliminates single points of failure.</p><figure> <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA2MzIwNjczMTM0NDg2ODY4/mobile-wallet_image-prev2.png" height="673" width="1200"> </figure> <h2>2. Consider your destination</h2><p>Consider your destination and travel plans when evaluating the risks of traveling with your bitcoin keys. What is the relative crime risk at your destination? Is your destination a high-crime nation or city? What will your surroundings be like?</p><p>If your destination has higher crime rates or pervasive petty theft, assume your phone will be stolen. Keep good smartphone security, and avoid holding keys to significant amounts of bitcoin on that device. Minimizing potential bitcoin losses by only keeping small amounts in mobile wallets is one consideration, but even storing keys to multisig wallets on your smartphone when traveling can increase the chances of compromise, necessitating <a href="https://unchained.com/blog/replace-key-multisig-wallet/?utm_campaign=btcmag-launch">an arduous key replacement</a>.</p><figure> <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA2MzIwNjczNDAyOTIyMzI0/bitcoin_events_header-prev1.png" height="674" width="1200"> </figure> <p>If you’re traveling to an event where ownership of bitcoin is assumed, adjust your security model around the assumption that everyone knows you own bitcoin. That could mean ensuring that any singlesig wallets have a passphrase, or securing smaller amounts of bitcoin with multisig and distributing the keys in your belongings while traveling.</p><h2>3. Avoid traveling with seed phrase backups</h2><p>You should <a href="https://unchained.com/blog/why-you-should-always-secure-your-seed-phrase-four-unexpected-errors/?utm_campaign=btcmag-launch">always secure your seed phrases</a>, but remember that they are the unencrypted secret for a given key, making them much easier to compromise than a hardware wallet. While your hardware wallet’s private key data is generally secured within a <a href="https://unchained.com/blog/bitcoin-what-is-a-secure-element/?utm_campaign=btcmag-launch">secure element</a>, behind a PIN, and requires a PC to access, seed phrase backups are easier to physically steal, copy, or photograph.</p><p>For most normal travel, you should leave your seed phrase backups in a secure storage location and travel with one or more hardware wallets.</p><figure> <a href="https://unchained.com/pricing/?utm_campaign=btcmag-launch" ><img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA2MjQ5NDY3Njc2OTkyNjg4/btcmag100_100_off_promo_1200x300-1.jpg" height="300" width="1200"></a> <figcaption><em>Visit </em><em><a href="https://unchained.com/pricing/?utm_campaign=btcmag-launch">Unchained.com</a></em><em> for $100 off any Unchained financial services product with code “</em><em><a href="https://unchained.com/pricing/?utm_campaign=btcmag-launch">BTCMAG100</a></em><em>”</em></figcaption> </figure> <h3>If you must travel with a seed phrase backup</h3><p>You might need to travel with a <a href="https://unchained.com/blog/what-is-a-bitcoin-seed-phrase/?utm_campaign=btcmag-launch">seed phrase backup</a> in some situations. Moving permanent physical residences (we <a href="https://unchained.com/blog/how-to-move-house-multisig/?utm_campaign=btcmag-launch">published a guide</a> that you should read if this is your situation) and traveling to set up a safely-stored key item in a multisig setup are both reasonable reasons to be traveling with your 12- or 24-word seed phrase.</p><figure> <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA2MzIwNjczNDAyOTg4MjM4/hot-wallet-guy-prev1.png" height="670" width="1200"> </figure> <p>If you must travel with a seed phrase, there are things you can do to minimize the chance of exposure and retain peace of mind:</p><ul><li><strong>Remain inconspicuous in airport security</strong>: Put a paper seed phrase backup inside a book, or split up a seed phrase by writing it in a physical notebook using some convention that you will remember. Avoid using suspicious metal locks or cases. If your bag gets pulled for suspicion, there’s a much greater chance your seed phrase will be seen.</li><li><strong>Use a passphrase for singlesig wallets</strong>: PINs can protect a hardware wallet, but a passphrase will protect your seed phrase! While passphrases are <a href="https://unchained.com/blog/bitcoin-singlesig-passphrase-vs-multisig/?utm_campaign=btcmag-launch">generally risky compared to other custody setups like multisig</a>, it can make sense to use one with a singlesig wallet while traveling with a seed phrase as long as it’s properly backed up (don’t rely on your memory!).</li><li><strong>Take advantage of traveling companions</strong>: Consider a multisig wallet (see below), give a travel companion one seed phrase, keep one seed phrase on your person, and store one seed phrase on a hardware wallet in a checked bag, for example. If you absolutely must ensure that one seed phrase is already at your destination, you can compromise one by storing it temporarily in a password manager prior to leaving (see below).</li></ul><h2>4. Watch what you say and show</h2><p>Before an attacker can attack, they need to know who they’re going after. This is where operational security comes in. Much of this advice applies to saving wealth with bitcoin in general, but it’s especially applicable while traveling.</p><figure> <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA2MzIwNjczNDAyOTIyNzAy/bitcoin_ninja-prev2.png" height="672" width="1200"> </figure> <p>On the go, you’re often at the whims of people and environments you can’t control. These are riskier situations to make it publicly known that you might hold substantial amounts of bitcoin.</p><ul><li><strong>Don’t talk about bitcoin with people you don’t trust</strong>: One of the easiest things you can do is simply talk about bitcoin less! Be cautious when “spreading the word.”</li><li><strong>Don’t put bitcoin stickers on your laptop or devices</strong>: These are like big neon signs that say, “this device is storing private key data!”</li><li><strong>Don’t wear bitcoin-related merchandise</strong>: Especially in places where people know what to look for, wearing merchandise or clothing with bitcoin logos unnecessarily puts a target on your back.</li><li><strong>Don’t talk about how much bitcoin you own</strong>: It’s generally a good idea to only share the amount of bitcoin you hold on a need-to-know basis. Knowing you’re a higher-value target might make an attacker consider more extreme or risky actions.</li></ul><p>Notably, these behaviors can create physical risk when traveling even if you don’t have any private key data on your person. If someone tries to attack you with a $5 wrench and you don’t have any bitcoin to give them, your bitcoin might survive, but your kneecaps might not!</p><h2>5. Create a decoy wallet</h2><p>Whether you’re traveling with a hardware wallet or software wallet, many wallets allow you to make a decoy wallet. Decoy wallets allow you to create a second wallet, entirely separate from your primary one, that you can activate in duress scenarios. With these, you typically add funds you’re willing to lose but significant enough to make the attacker think they got what they wanted.</p><figure> <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA2MzIwNjczMTM0NTUyNDA0/coldard_hardware_wallet_wearing_a_disguise-prev1.png" height="670" width="1200"> </figure> <p>There are a few different ways to set up a decoy bitcoin wallet:</p><ol><li>Singlesig + passphrase</li><li>Use one key in a multisig quorum</li><li>Duress PIN</li></ol><h3>Singlesig + passphrase</h3><p>With a passphrase, you can set up a secondary wallet that would give an attacker access to a small subset of your funds. You could also make the primary wallet a decoy while using a passphrase for your main wallet. Always <a href="https://unchained.com/blog/bitcoin-singlesig-passphrase-vs-multisig/?utm_campaign=btcmag-launch">consider the tradeoffs of using a passphrase</a>, however, and always ensure you have your passphrase properly backed up (it’s case-sensitive).</p><h3>Multisig</h3><p>If you use multisig, as long as you can keep it a secret that any given hardware wallet or seed phrase is part of a multisig setup, you can protect yourself by using one of the keys in the quorum as a decoy. To do this, simply use one hardware or software wallet normally part of your multisig setup as a standalone wallet. An attacker could access the funds sent to the singlesig wallet associated with that seed while not accessing—or even knowing about—the wallet constructed with multisig.</p><h3>Duress PIN</h3><p>Some wallet makers allow you to set up a duress PIN. With this functionality, you can set up a second PIN that gives an attacker access to a second decoy wallet. If you’re attacked, give the attacker the wrong PIN and let them have the smaller subset of funds in that wallet.</p><p>As an example, the Coldcard hardware wallet offers three types of duress PINs: one that unlocks a decoy wallet, one that destroys the seed upon entry, and one that creates a countdown to customizable “brick modes”. These tools offer you confidence that attackers won’t be able to access your primary bitcoin keys—if any at all.</p><h2>6. Consider multisig to eliminate single points of failure</h2><p>Bitcoin’s native multisig feature can help create decoy wallets, but it’s also a powerful tool for mitigating travel risk generally. Perhaps you need to travel with private keys, but want to avoid the single point of failure of singlesig wallets. Traveling with three hardware wallets, each key held as one in a multisig quorum, can help reduce your risk.</p><figure> <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA2MzIwNjczMTM0NTUyNzgy/221012_security_best_practices_header_1920x1080px.png" height="675" width="1200"> </figure> <p>There are many unique capabilities that multisig opens for you if you’re traveling. Each of the following have security implications and trade-offs to consider beyond the scope of this article, but you could:</p><ul><li><strong>Distribute held keys while traveling</strong>: You can travel on a plane with a 2-of-3 multisig where one key is on your person, another key is in a secret compartment in your carry-on luggage, with a third key and seed phrase backups geographically distributed in other secure locations. This keeps three keys separated, requiring two of the three to come together to spend funds.</li><li><strong>Digitally store a seed phrase</strong>: Temporarily compromising a seed phrase by storing it in a password manager ensures that at least one seed phrase backup to your multisig quorum is already at your destination. When you arrive at the destination, you can <a href="https://unchained.com/blog/replace-key-multisig-wallet/?utm_campaign=btcmag-launch">conduct a key replacement</a> for any seed phrase temporarily stored on an internet-connected device.</li><li><strong>Mail yourself a hardware wallet or seed phrase</strong>: If you’re traveling with substantial bitcoin funds and you don’t want to expose yourself to theft from physical attacks in a 2-of-3 multisig while traveling, for example, you can mail one hardware wallet or seed phrase your destination, carry one key on your person, and then still be able to spend funds when you arrive.</li><li><strong>Partner countersigns</strong>: A custody partner, whether that be a financial institution like Unchained or trusted third-party, can coordinate with you to sign transactions while traveling if you want to travel with a minority of keys in multisig.</li></ul><p>You can use a tool like <a href="https://sparrowwallet.com/">Sparrow</a>, <a href="https://electrum.org/#home">Electrum</a>, or <a href="https://unchained-capital.github.io/caravan/#/?utm_campaign=btcmag-launch">our very own Caravan</a> to construct multisig wallets yourself, and if you need help setting up multisig or understanding travel best practices in the context of collaborative custody, <a href="https://unchained.com/concierge/?utm_campaign=btcmag-launch">we have a team</a> that can help you with that.</p><h2>7. Have an inheritance plan</h2><p>It’s a good idea for anyone with substantive bitcoin wealth to have an inheritance plan, but that’s especially the case when traveling. If something were to happen to you while traveling, you want peace of mind knowing that your bitcoin will be rightfully passed to your next of kin without a hitch.</p><figure> <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA2MzIwNjczMTM0NDg3MjQ2/inheritance-protocol-prev1.png" height="673" width="1200"> </figure> <p>This would be very difficult if traveling with your self-custody bitcoin in a singlesig wallet, but multisig—and even better for inheritance purposes, including a collaborative custody partner in your multisig setup—can give you the best of all worlds: convenient access to your self-custody bitcoin and peace of mind knowing it will be taken care of in your absence.</p><p>We previously wrote an article explaining the intricacies of <a href="https://unchained.com/blog/how-to-inheritance-plan-unchained-vault/?utm_campaign=btcmag-launch">how to set up an inheritance plan for your bitcoin</a> if that’s something you want to consider before traveling.</p><figure> <a href="https://unchained.com/pricing/?utm_campaign=btcmag-launch" ><img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA2MjQ5NDY3Njc2OTkyNjg4/btcmag100_100_off_promo_1200x300-1.jpg" height="300" width="1200"></a> <figcaption><em>Visit </em><em><a href="https://unchained.com/pricing/?utm_campaign=btcmag-launch">Unchained.com</a></em><em> for $100 off any Unchained financial services product with code “</em><em><a href="https://unchained.com/pricing/?utm_campaign=btcmag-launch">BTCMAG100</a></em><em>”</em></figcaption> </figure> <h2>More bitcoin security considerations</h2><p>Traveling procedures are important, but there’s so much more to bitcoin key security.

<![CDATA[ <p><em>Originally posted on <a href="https://medium.com/breez-technology/orange-pilling-has-stopped-working-4a407252c7a3">Medium</a>.</em></p><p>In the context of bitcoin, “<a href="https://slate.com/technology/2022/05/bitcoin-and-crypto-crash-a-guide-for-normies.html">normie</a>” means something like “don’t know, don’t care.” And “normie” comes from “normal.” In other words, normal people don’t care about bitcoin, at least not enough to use it.</p><p>Lack of exposure is not the problem. Bitcoin now regularly appears in the headlines of mainstream media, like <a href="https://eu.usatoday.com/story/money/investing/2024/04/21/is-bitcoin-a-millionaire-maker/73380530007/">USAToday</a>, <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/bitcoin-holds-steady-after-completing-fourth-ever-halving/ar-AA1noAlf">Fox</a>, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/advisor/in/investing/cryptocurrency/bitcoin-halving-2024/">Forbes</a>, <a href="https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2024/03/06/bitcoins-price-is-surging-what-happens-next">The Economist</a>, <a href="https://www.lemonde.fr/pixels/article/2024/03/05/le-bitcoin-atteint-un-niveau-jamais-atteint-a-plus-de-69-000-dollars_6220260_4408996.html">Le Monde</a>, you name it. The term <em>bitcoin</em> generates more search traffic than other terms most of us are sick of hearing, like <em>kardashian</em><em>.</em></p><figure> <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA2MzEzOTg0NTI4MjI5NTUy/kardashian.jpg" height="701" width="1200"> <figcaption><em>Search results for "bitcoin" and "kardashian"</em></figcaption> </figure> <p>But even though virtually every human and most seagulls have heard of bitcoin, <a href="https://buybitcoinworldwide.com/how-many-bitcoin-users/">fewer than half a million</a> use it daily.</p><p>And it’s not for lack of effort on the part of the bitcoin community. We’ve written <a href="https://www.amazon.com/bitcoin-Books/s?k=bitcoin&rh=n%3A283155">books</a>, blogs (so many blogs!), recorded <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=bitcoin">videos</a>, organized conferences and meetups, and hosted podcasts (so many podcasts!) preaching the value of bitcoin. We put more effort into converting the nocoin infidels than most religions, but our beautiful temple remains sadly empty.</p><p>Educating the world about bitcoin has succeeded in building a community of knowledgeable, dedicated, enthusiastic people from the fields of tech, economics, politics, and finance, but orange pilling has taken us as far as it can. Like many strategies, the marginal gains of educating the world were remarkable in the early stages, but they’ve flattened.</p><p>Orange pilling has stopped working.</p><h2>Show, Don't Tell</h2><p>I realize how controversial this claim is because orange pilling is so popular. It’s a strategy that has served us really well over the past 15 years. And most bitcoiners like education. We tend to be critical thinkers who devour blogs and books and podcasts to learn more about our passion and keep our minds sharp.</p><p>But we don’t research <em>every topic</em>, nor do we have to. I know very little about what a good workout and eating healthy do to my body on a cellular level, but I feel the benefits of both. In fact, our world is so complex that nobody can really understand all the important facets. How many welders and virologists or aeronautical engineers and app developers really understand each others’ fields? Most people are ignorant about most useful topics, and that’s just the way it is in a highly complex world.</p><p>Expertise, however, is not a precondition of enjoyment. I use all kinds of products and technologies — TikTok, AI assistants, and even water-treatment plants — simply because they make my life better. That’s all I really need to know. No technical understanding required.</p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/y5QbrRRMg20" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><p>All you need to benefit from a technology is utility. It just has to improve people’s lives somehow, whether they understand it at a granular level or not. We can tell people about bitcoin’s benefits until we’re exhausted and they’re annoyed. What matters is how they actually experience it. We should stop telling them how great the bitcoin economy is going to be and start showing them. Less theory, more practice.</p><p>Think of remote work. In the 1970s, big companies like IBM were merely toying with the idea, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_work#History">experimenting with a few workers</a> at a time. Then technology happened: broadband & WiFi, corporate VPNs, cloud storage, cheap and powerful computers for pockets and desks. And don’t forget all the software: Zoom, Teams, Slack, Meet, SharePoint, etc.</p><p>But even just a decade ago, remote work was something many had heard of, but few had tried. It was growing at just a few percent per year. Enter COVID. Rates doubled, then tripled. Now <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1450450/employees-remote-work-share/">67% of us techies</a> work mostly or entirely from home.</p><p>Yes, COVID was a shock, but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_epidemics_and_pandemics">pandemics are nothing new</a>. The last one revolutionized the geography of work because of the tech. The technology had become really useful, and the pandemic just gave us the occasion to realize it. Would the revolution in remote work have happened eventually without the pandemic? Almost certainly, if not as fast. Would it have happened eventually without the technology? The question doesn’t even make sense because the technology defines how we even think about “remote work.”</p><p>Useful technology changes behavior, habits, and society. Sometimes radically.</p><p>We bitcoiners need to learn, internalize, and remember this lesson. <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/important-to-teach-people-about-bitcoin">The orange pills</a> have stopped working, at least at our current scale. Experiences are what change people’s minds, and we build those experiences with technology, not conferences. As soon as we start delivering experiences that surpass anything fiat can do, people will adopt bitcoin automatically. Until we start delivering such services, no amount of books and blogs will change their minds or habits.</p><figure> <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA2MzEzOTY4NDIyMTAyMTky/orange_pill.jpg" height="800" width="1200"> <figcaption><em>Orange pills were once medicine; now they're just candy. (Image: </em><a href="https://www.publicdomainpictures.net/en/view-image.php?image=168807&amp;picture=medication">George Hodan</a><em>)</em></figcaption> </figure> <h2>Where to Start</h2><p>So if the key is to improve people’s lives, whose lives are we talking about? There’s a big difference between <a href="https://medium.com/breez-technology/the-breez-release-candidate-getting-lightning-ready-for-the-global-takeover-b5d1f9756229">a corner store in Hyderabad</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/breez-technology/lightning-in-the-wild-victoria-kayak-9119e863b87b">outdoorsy Canadians</a>. Different interests, different needs.</p><p>Think about the revolutionary technologies of recent decades: the television, the PC, the internet, the smartphone, Facebook, <em>AI</em>. They all took root in the same demographic: people with disposable income in developed countries. Facebook took this approach to the extreme by first opening <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Facebook">only to students attending elite Western universities</a>. And now it’s your aunt’s favorite technology. Another lesson.</p><p>So the way forward is to leverage bitcoin’s strengths as a borderless, open, censorship resistant, and — most importantly — P2P currency in order to improve the lives of affluent people with money to spend. Give them better ways to transact directly with each other.</p><p>In practice, this will often mean <a href="https://medium.com/breez-technology/we-need-more-apps-with-lightning-not-more-lightning-apps-b5f37f9ac8bd">adding bitcoin to apps they use anyway</a>. It might also mean disintermediating services they’re already using. Like connecting gig drivers to passengers directly without Uber taking its cut. Like connecting artists directly to fans without Spotify and the record companies taking their cut. Like paying Dashers directly without DoorDash taking its cut.</p><p>The winning formula is to insert our tech into an existing, suboptimal user experience, just like the <a href="https://medium.com/breez-technology/we-need-more-apps-with-lightning-not-more-lightning-apps-b5f37f9ac8bd">iPhone did with the digital camera</a>. Utility improves the UX, and the UX drives adoption. <a href="https://quoteinvestigator.com/2019/01/13/margin/">The incumbents’ margin is our opportunity</a>. This is the essence of disruption.</p><p>Let me also clarify that better gadgets for affluent Westerners are not more important than giving people in developing countries access to modern financial services and shelter from their governments’ corruption. That’s vital too. It’s just that affluent Westerners are a more effective way to move the market and propagate the technology. They’re the gateway drug, the beachhead to mainstream adoption. But yes, changing the whole world and improving the lives of everyone in it with bitcoin remains the ultimate goal.</p><h2>Utility > Education</h2><p>Education is important for people who need the inside-baseball-level information — entrepreneurs, engineers, investors, etc. It’s usually easier to improve a thing if you understand how it works than through random trial and error.</p><p>To just use a thing, though, all you need to know is how, not why. <a href="https://books.google.de/books?hl=en&lr=&id=Dx7slq__udwC&oi=fnd&pg=PT1&ots=Wf6LgYD3DQ&sig=rev8wMoq3t6gFscbjrAMcd_W8gQ&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false">Dozens of animal species</a> use tools to make their lives better. A few of them might have a vague idea of the tools’ operating principles — thick stick = strong and rigid; thin stick = light and flexible — and that’s enough. All of us use countless technologies already without understanding them, simply because we like the experience.</p><p>We don’t really have to conduct much research about how to improve people’s experiences with bitcoin. It’s easy to find <a href="https://www.visualcapitalist.com/cp/most-popular-apps-by-downloads/">which apps are most popular</a>. Many, if not most, if not all of them could be improved with borderless P2P payments, right? That’s the whole idea, right? So let’s add our borderless P2P payments to them or rebuild them with our tech. If we do it right, and bitcoin really is better (which of course it is), then we won’t have to convince people anymore. They’ll just adopt it and convince each other.</p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ <p>The Executive Office of US President Joe Biden has <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/SAP-HJRes109.pdf">announced</a> its stance on proposed legislation, H.J. Res. 109, that would allow highly regulated financial firms to act as custodians for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. </p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">JUST IN: 🇺🇸 US President Joe Biden Administration says Biden would veto legislation that would allow highly regulated financial firms to custody <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bitcoin?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Bitcoin</a> and crypto. <a href="https://t.co/aXx8aq1m0Z">pic.twitter.com/aXx8aq1m0Z</a></p>&mdash; Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) <a href="https://twitter.com/BitcoinMagazine/status/1788274505753755836?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 8, 2024</a></blockquote> <script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> <p>"The Administration strongly opposes passage of H.J. Res. 109, which would disrupt the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) work to protect investors in crypto-asset markets and to safeguard the broader financial system," The Executive Office of The President stated. "If the President were presented with H.J. Res. 109, he would veto it."</p><p>H.J.Res. 109 would overturn the SEC’s Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 121, which imposes restrictions on financial institutions regarding the custody of digital assets, under the Congressional Review Act (CRA). By overturning SAB 121, this bipartisan resolution would remove roadblocks that prevent highly regulated financial institutions and firms from acting as custodians for Bitcoin and digital assets.</p><p>US Congressman Patrick McHenry, Chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, <a href="https://financialservices.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=409247">expressed support</a> for overturning the SEC's SAB 121, stating, “Staff Accounting Bulletin, or SAB, 121 is one of the most glaring examples of the regulatory overreach that has defined Gary Gensler’s tenure at the SEC. Through SAB 121, the Commission is trying to dictate how financial institutions and firms safeguard Americans’ digital assets under the guise of so-called staff guidance.”</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/WATCH?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#WATCH</a>: Chairman <a href="https://twitter.com/PatrickMcHenry?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@PatrickMcHenry</a> delivers remarks in support of H.J.Res. 109 to nullify SAB 121:<br><br>&quot;This bipartisan resolution is an essential effort to protect consumers and foster innovation in digital asset markets.&quot;<br><br>Read more 🔗<a href="https://t.co/jnIBJFHIPj">https://t.co/jnIBJFHIPj</a><br><br>📺 Watch 👇 <a href="https://t.co/fOxOh8DtWH">pic.twitter.com/fOxOh8DtWH</a></p>&mdash; Financial Services GOP (@FinancialCmte) <a href="https://twitter.com/FinancialCmte/status/1788250258885038239?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 8, 2024</a></blockquote> <script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> <p>“SAB 121 requires financial institutions and firms that are safeguarding their customers’ digital assets to hold those assets on their balance sheet," McHenry continued. “That means banks would be required to take on significant capital, liquidity, and other costs under the existing prudential regulatory framework. This essentially makes it cost prohibitive for financial institutions to custody their customers’ digital assets. This is a massive deviation from how highly regulated banks are traditionally required to treat the assets they hold on behalf of their customers.”<em> </em></p><p>US Congressman French Hill also spoke out in support for H.J. Res. 109, saying that "Holding reserves against the assets held in custody is NOT standard financial services practice. The Biden Admin's SAB 121 is misguided and should be nullified."</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Holding reserves against the assets held in custody is NOT standard financial services practice. <br><br>The Biden Admin&#39;s SAB 121 is misguided and should be nullified.

We’ve seen wallets that want to just provide the sharpest UX at the cost of self-custody or privacy. We've seen wallets from Silicon Valley that close you into a walled garden.</p><p>Zeus wants to enable you to make Bitcoin payments your way, whether it be that you’re just starting off and want to spin up a full lightning node in your pocket [editor’s note: ZEUS enables you to run a Lightning node on your phone] or, if you're a more seasoned veteran, and you have a full node running at home. Maybe it's an <a href="https://umbrel.com/">Umbrel</a> or <a href="https://start9.com/">Start9</a>, or maybe you're even running something in the cloud with <a href="https://voltage.cloud/">Voltage</a> — you can connect to ZEUS with that, too.</p><p>There are multiple ways to connect. There are multiple backends we support. We just want to empower people to make Lightning payments as freely as possible, with as few intermediaries as possible and with as much privacy as possible.</p><p><strong>Corva:</strong> Given the recent crackdown on the Samourai developers followed by Phoenix stopping its services for US customers and then <a href="https://thedefiant.io/news/regulation/wasabi-wallet-to-eliminate-coinjoin-amid-u-s-regulatory-fears">Wasabi Wallet shutting down its coinjoin service</a>, do you feel like it’s inevitable that the authorities will target ZEUS at some point?</p><p><strong>Kaloudis:</strong> I think there's a really good chance that down the line Zeus does get targeted. It's almost an inevitability unless the outlook on Bitcoin in this country drastically changes.</p><p>And regulators have no idea how the Lightning Network works. It can be interpreted in so many different ways. But they know when they want to come down with the clamps, they have to come down strong.</p><p>That really helps put stuff in perspective for us as developers and people offering products and services. We still have a long way to go despite the great strides that we've made in the last six or seven years.</p><p><strong>Corva:</strong> It’s interesting how bitcoin’s price rising seems to have little to do with people adopting it as a medium of exchange.</p><p><strong>Kaloudis:</strong> What is the general use case of Bitcoin right now? It's just people just trading it like a stock or using it as an entry tool to gamble on shitcoins and meme coins this cycle. People don't [grasp] the technology fully. Meanwhile, the people up top are seeing the writing on the wall and trying to nip it in the bud while they can — medium of exchange is really the largest threat to them.</p><p>The Michael Saylors of the world, the Larry Finks of the world, the people offering up the ETFs who stand to benefit from number go up only would love nothing more than if everyone who was getting into it were neatly arranged and accounted for, KYC and all, and if it really didn't take hold as something people self custodied or used as a medium of exchange.</p><p><strong>Corva:</strong> Is this why in the latest iteration of ZEUS you put the node in the phone instead of assuming that people would run a node at home and then use ZEUS as a remote control of sorts? In other words, are you trying to make it easier for people to use bitcoin as a medium of exchange?</p><p><strong>Kaloudis:</strong> We really bridged a gap for them by putting it in the phone and offering up basically all the same functionality that a remote user would have.</p><p>I think ZEUS is going to really evolve pretty drastically, but our priority and our two hard lines are self custody and no KYC.</p><p>I would rather either stop offering these Bitcoin payment channels in certain jurisdictions — we already have to comply with like with OFAC — or shut the company down. </p><p>We've built such a great product that empowers so many people that even without <a href="https://terminal.lightning.engineering/explore/031b301307574bbe9b9ac7b79cbe1700e31e544513eae0b5d7497483083f99e581/">Olympus</a> (a well-connected Lightning node that ZEUS runs) and our <a href="https://docs.lightning.engineering/the-lightning-network/liquidity/lightning-service-provider">LSP</a> services, I'm confident there'd be thousands of people still using the software. And I'm sure people would continue to contribute to it at an open-source level to keep making it better.</p><p><strong>Corva:</strong> It’s disheartening to think that someone like you would even think about having to walk away from your company. There aren’t many people in this space who can build what you’ve built and this makes me think the next person with your skills might just consider not even getting started as a founder in this space.</p><p><strong>Kaloudis:</strong> With this crackdown, we’ve seen a real chilling effect. It’s a real home run for the opposing side, and there's definitely potential for things to snowball and for more people to move out of the market.</p><p>I really do hope that my actions encourage others to stand up and not self-police or leave markets preemptively.</p><p>On the other hand, if you talk to people who are developing the space or doing their own startup, they already know that what they're doing is crazy. They know that, “Hey, I can go work for one of these FAANG companies and make $200, $300 grand easily, and I make a fraction of that with a fraction of a chance of success if I go and work on Bitcoin and try to start my own company.”</p><p>But that’s the thing with Bitcoin developers — despite all the challenges that lay ahead and the pressures that are mounting, there's nothing else they'd rather do. This is a moonshot, but if it succeeds, the entire world changes. So, I think there's still going to be a lot of crazy devs.</p><p><strong>Corva:</strong> Do you think these developers will be a bit less publicly antagonistic after seeing what happened to the Samourai developers and how prosecutors are using the <a href="https://twitter.com/SamouraiWallet/status/1542533704635015168">tweet</a> in which they welcomed Russian oligarchs to use their service in the case against them? Do you think it’s better to go on the offensive verbally or to just keep your head down and work quietly?</p><p><strong>Kaloudis:</strong> Man, it's just so fun when you come out with the bravado, you know? And the Samourai guys built an entire brand around it. They essentially assembled an army of diehard fans and users and that largely contributed to their success.</p><p>If you are a nym and you have the ability, then please continue the shit talking. But if you're a public figure, it's not going to be wise to poke the bear or kick the hornet's nest, as Satoshi said.</p><p>We do need to start thinking a little more critically. There are still a lot of concessions we are going to have to make in the battles that are happening now. You need to be strategic to win a war.</p><p><strong>Corva:</strong> Let’s shift over to something more optimistic — your plans for ZEUS — and let me ask you some questions that some plebs on Nostr and X asked me to ask you. Are you exploring ways for self-custodial users to receive payments without initially having to fund a channel with Bitcoin and what would this look like?</p><p><strong>Kaloudis:</strong> Great question. On the self custodial front, there are a lot of challenges. We have people like <a href="https://twitter.com/super_testnet?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">Super Testnet</a> who have figured out really innovative ways to do things self custodially with payments, like what we've done with our <a href="https://coinsnap.io/en/what-is-a-lightning-address/">ZEUS Lightning address</a> and stuff like this new <a href="https://www.nobsbitcoin.com/introducing-hedgehog/">hedgehog protocol</a>.</p><p>The pre-funding issue still remains. It’s a tricky challenge that we're trying to address.</p><p>I ultimately think that a lot of protocol level changes have to happen to Bitcoin. Those are the things that we're more bullish on — the things that still enable self custody. We're really bullish on <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/youll-activate-the-covenants-and-youll-like-it">covenants</a>. We're really bullish on coin pools and payment pools. Stuff like <a href="https://www.arkpill.me/">Ark</a> is pretty novel.</p><p>We don't really want people to break the bank to set up payment channels. As Bitcoin's price keeps going up, it becomes more expensive, at least in dollar terms, to open your first channel and use ZEUS in a self-custodial way.</p><p>We want to try to avoid that moving forward, but it's going to take more and more plebs pushing to say, “Hey, this ossification push is stupid. It cripples Bitcoin.” And the Larry Finks, the Michael Saylor types we were talking about earlier would love nothing more than if the core code base and protocol just stayed as is. Think about who really benefits if things stay that way.</p><p>Let's be open minded as we push forward and let's see what other proposals come down the line, because there's a lot more we have to do to scale.</p><p><strong>Corva:</strong> When can you bring splicing to ZEUS?</p><p><strong>Kaloudis:</strong> Splicing is [some]thing we depend on <a href="https://docs.lightning.engineering/lightning-network-tools/lnd">LND</a> for. I'd love to bring it in, but who knows? We probably could see in the core Lightning interfaces, too. It would probably be easier to see that sooner than in say the embedded node in Zeus. More so than what it enables users [to do], it would really benefit us as the Lightning Service Provider in reducing costs.</p><p><strong>Corva:</strong> In what ways does ZEUS integrate with Nostr?</p><p><strong>Kaloudis:</strong> Zeus today has two Nostr integrations.</p><p>We have a contact book in Zeus in which you can import all your contacts from Nostr. This gives you a great way to easily send your payments to people you follow. In that way, it's sort of like a decentralized Cash App or decentralized Venmo for payments for people familiar with that in the US.</p><p>We also use Nostr to power our self-custodial Lightning address service, which is the first of its kind on a mobile wallet powered by the great Super Testnet <a href="https://www.nobsbitcoin.com/zaplocker-com-non-custodial-lightning-address-server/">ZapLocker</a> spec and basically use Nostr keys to sign off on the invoices that our server serves up to users. So, if you have a compatible ZapLocker wallet, you can say, “Oh yeah, this invoice hash, this got signed by Frank and I'll press this button to make sure I'm really looking at Frank's profile and that it's really him who signed off on it.”</p><p><strong>Corva:</strong> With all of the innovations you bring to ZEUS, do you keep existing regulations in mind as you build or do you just build and hope you’re not breaking any laws?</p><p><strong>Kaloudis:</strong> We have to act in good faith. We have already put measures up that will prevent bad actors from using our system.</p><p>We're going to have to likely show regulators, if they come knocking on our door, that it's not just a free for all here. And we have data that can help us identify and kick bad users off our platform.</p><p>I'm not going to say, “Hey, Russian oligarchs come use Olympus,” because you're not going to get far if you try to do that. ZEUS is just not conducive to that at all.</p><p>What ZEUS is conducive to is to be able to freely make your day-to-day payments.</p><p>What is guiding us is our hard lines, and our hard lines are self custody and no KYC. We’re not making payments on behalf of users. We’re just empowering them to make those payments for themselves.</p><p>If we get labeled as a money service business, then everything else goes, from individual Lightning node operators to miners potentially to self custody itself. And like I said in my post, that's the hill to die on — self custody.</p><p>The alternative is just too grim to even think about and it's going to take some individuals, largely in the United States, to stand up.</p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ <p>Ordinal Derangement Syndrome (ODS) is a real phenomenon. As a neutral observer from Bitcoin Magazine, I aim to address the misconceptions and dismissive attitudes toward Ordinals in the Bitcoin community, revealing the overlooked complexities and potential within what I term 'Ordinal Derangement Syndrome' (ODS).</p><p>ODS emerges as a significant phenomenon within a segment of the Bitcoin community, characterized by an oversimplification and dismissive attitude toward Ordinals, often cavalier in nature. As an employee of Bitcoin Magazine, who remains neutral toward Ordinals but is tired of the baseless criticism aimed not just at our publication but at Bitcoin innovations at large, I feel compelled to share my perspective. Contrary to some assertions, our coverage does not obsess over Ordinals nor provide coverage to an unreasonable extent.</p><p>The conversation about Ordinals amongst detractors is frequently reduced to unfounded accusations of scams or spam clogging the mempool, which reflects a "mid-wit" mentality prevalent among certain Bitcoin influencers. These individuals neglect the intricate details of Ordinals, opting to leverage the topic for personal gains, such as gaining more followers or enhancing their online presence. Whether these actions are intentional or not, with deliberate manipulation being especially egregious, they indicate a superficial engagement with the technology. Such behavior fails to acknowledge the complexity of Ordinals, which merits a more detailed and considerate analysis, and thus epitomizes Ordinal Derangement Syndrome (ODS).</p><p>It's disappointing to witness a portion of the Bitcoin community engage in such reductive discussions, particularly given the thoughtful reasoning that initially attracted many to Bitcoin. This tendency is most apparent among those who aligned with Bitcoin around 2020 — or the class of the fourth epoch — and whose understanding of Bitcoin is heavily influenced by "The Bitcoin Standard" and the literal interpretation of Satoshi’s blog posts on the Bitcoin talk forum. This approach, akin to the zealotry seen in religious fanaticism, has led to a skewed interpretation of Bitcoin Maximalism, transforming it into the sole identity of its adherents. At times, it's almost as if those exhibiting ODS are secretly or unwittingly supporters of Bitcoin Cash (BCash) or Bitcoin SV (BSV), given their behavior.</p><p>Some context around my personal beliefs includes:</p><p>1. Ordinals (what many refer to JPEGs on Bitcoin) are dumb.</p><p>2. I understand Ordinals have subjective value.</p><p>3. Ordinals have resurfaced bitcoin scaling issues.</p><p>4. Bitcoin is resistant to Bitcoiners.</p><p>5. Bitcoin is permissionless.</p><p><em>I have never owned, been gifted, or intended to own an Ordinal or inscription.</em></p><p>Contrary to the perception of Ordinal and Bitcoin Magazine detractors, Ordinals constitute a minimal percentage of what Bitcoin Magazine covers. Since the beginning of the year, Bitcoin Magazine has published 327 articles on its website, with only 5 covering Ordinals, constituting approximately 1.5% of our published content this year.</p><p>The navigation bar on our website includes sections for Articles, PRO (market insights), Store, Conference, Mining, Learn, Books, and Buy Bitcoin. Notably, Ordinals do not have their own dedicated section. Of the 31 print issues released, only one focused on inscriptions.</p><p>Our recent print issue, entitled "The Inscription Issue," spotlights inscriptions and Ordinals as the core of a significant cultural issue within the Bitcoin community, hence why it's called "The Inscription ISSUE."</p><p>Let me underscore some of our recent initiatives that demonstrate our broader primary interests and focus:</p><ul><li>We have formed a partnership with the industry's leading Bitcoin collaborative custody business. This collaboration is designed to provide new Bitcoin buyers with the knowledge and tools necessary for self-custody, including the setup of a multi-signature solution. More details at: <a href="https://unchained.bitcoinmagazine.com/">https://unchained.bitcoinmagazine.com/</a></li><li>Our largest content series include collaboration with one of the largest hardware wallet providers globally to promote technical content on self-custody best practices. For instance, see "10 Steps to Self-Sovereignty" at <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/sponsored/understanding-your-bitcoin-keys-bip39-seed-words">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/sponsored/understanding-your-bitcoin-keys-bip39-seed-words</a></li><li>We have also partnered with one of the biggest miners to tackle mainstream Bitcoin FUD. See "FUD Fighters" at <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/sponsored/mining-misinformation-how-the-united-nations-university-misrepresented-data-to-exaggerate-bitcoins-environmental-footprint">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/sponsored/mining-misinformation-how-the-united-nations-university-misrepresented-data-to-exaggerate-bitcoins-environmental-footprint</a></li></ul><p>Our conference team has expanded our events to Asia and the MENA regions, specifically China and the UAE. Our conferences predominantly focus on the economic, energy, and open-source benefits of Bitcoin, making up more than 90% of the conference content.</p><p>At Bitcoin 2023, our most recent flagship event, Ordinals received minor attention:</p><ul><li>Main Stage: Out of 52 talks, only 1 discussed Ordinals (the Great Ordinal Debate), representing approximately 1% focus on Ordinals.<br><br></li><li>Enterprise Stage: Out of 16 applicants for Pitch Day, 1 company presented on Ordinals (Ordinal Safe, which did not win), and 2 talk tracks of the 15 were focused on Ordinals, accounting for roughly 9% focus.<br><br></li><li>Mining Stage and Open-Source Stage: There was no focus on Ordinals.</li></ul><p>In total, only 4 out of 128 tracks touched on Ordinals, constituting 3% of the total conference programming.</p><p>Now I don’t want to speak for The Bitcoin Conference but at Bitcoin Magazine, it is our objective to cover all facets of Bitcoin, including Ordinals. To overlook Ordinals would be irresponsible, given their impact on-chain, their potential long-term consequences, and their role in transforming UTXO and block space valuation.<br><br>As an independent media outlet we platform everyone - for the sake of discussion that meets our very public editorial guidelines in order to allow individuals to come to their own conclusions. We drive discourse and welcome competing bitcoin narratives. Being selective would make us no different than FOX News, CNN, or MSNBC. </p><p>Ordinals are controversial, and addressing controversy requires more dialogue, not less. Withdrawing from a conference or criticizing an organization due to perceived "moral superiority" often reflects underlying issues like pandering, grifting, or lack of intellectual rigor.</p><p>While some might interpret this perceived moral high ground as stemming from "compassion for no-coiners or those new to Bitcoin," it's crucial to examine the situation more critically, as it often reflects dynamics similar to US Far Left Progressive Cancel Culture. Comparing these political phenomena to the unfolding politics within the Bitcoin community, one can notice the rise of "Bitcoin wokisms" and purity tests, increasingly regarded as thought leadership. To understand the potential direction of this trend, one can observe the impact of cancel culture in the United States. Here, concepts like Safe Spaces, Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI), and Make America Great Again (MAGA) have been paralleled with Bitcoin narratives:</p><ul><li>Safe Spaces are similar to those who demand for filtering bitcoin transactions.(#FixTheFilters). You could also compare ‘filterbois’ to COVID-19 vaccine mandate advocates. </li><li>The universal potential for Bitcoin adoption and advancement has been overshadowed by pejorative accusations of scamming towards those proposing scaling solutions. Similar to how DEI argues for equitable outcome, many bitcoiners are claiming that transacting on mainchain bitcoin is also equitable.</li><li>Calls to solidify Bitcoin's current state echo the MAGA movement, advocating for no change or reversion to “better times."<br></li></ul><p>Much like how the term "Nazi" has been appropriated by the far left and MAGA types were disillusioned into thinking that the economy under Trump was "just fine," we're witnessing a similar appropriation of the words "scam," "spam," and "shitcoin," with most uses being based on opinion rather than fact.</p><p>Such dilution of terms diminishes their meaning and legitimacy, leads to imprecision in public discourse, and undermines the identification of real threats. This is regrettable because, within the context of Ordinals, there are genuine scams, including artificially inflated marketplaces and affinity scams disguised as Ordinal projects run by proponents of Bitcoin SV. Rather than highlight differences, the focus has shifted to pejorative arguments against Ordinals, rather than engaging in discourse about the technical underpinnings and how we even got here in the first place, which is a far larger issue. I’m looking at all of you Bitcoin twitter folk who larped for Taproot with green square emojis!</p><p>ODS has also resulted in the emerging tendency to use Ordinals as a basis and excuse to overlook Bitcoin’s non-monetary applications, which is deeply troubling. This perspective conveniently overlooks Bitcoin’s significant innovation in leveraging stranded energy to lower emissions and secure the network and additionally, it disregards Bitcoin's capabilities in enabling proof of existence, providing timestamping solutions, facilitating decentralized domain name systems, supporting immutable messaging, and enhancing decentralized identity verification.</p><p>While Bitcoin is primarily money, ignoring its other functionalities is shortsighted and misguided. It's critical to acknowledge and explore the full spectrum of Bitcoin's applications, as restricting our view to its financial aspect alone is a limited approach.</p><p>Moreover, the belief that Bitcoin’s global adoption will mirror the individual discovery journey of its 2020 (or 4th halving) cohort is a narrow perspective. It's essential to recognize that the path to widespread acceptance and use of Bitcoin may be as diverse and multifaceted as its potential applications. Dismissing the evolving nature of Bitcoin’s adoption and utility risks sidelining oneself from the ongoing developments and conversations, especially in a permissionless environment.</p><p>Canceling discourse does not challenge discourse.</p><p>Don't be a victim of ODS. </p> ]]>

Prepared by Joe Burnett for Unchained.</figcaption> </figure> <h2>Bitcoin is a deep freeze</h2><p>As humanity continues to excel in producing goods, services, knowledge, and financial assets, we're now made painfully aware of a new problem: how ineffective our saving is when everything we save can be produced in greater quantities or devalued by competitive markets. Traditional saving methods, from dollars to real estate, are increasingly challenged by our own capacity for production, which in turn devalues these assets. Another way to think about this is that these assets are simply “bad money,” but compared to what?</p><blockquote><p>"Bitcoin is the only thing in the world that is inelastic to price."<br>- Michael Saylor</p></blockquote><p>Enter bitcoin, a paradigm shift in the concept of saving. Bitcoin stands apart as a novel monetary tool with unique properties that redefine what we consider to be money. Unlike traditional assets, bitcoin is designed with an immutable, fixed supply–there will only ever be 21 million bitcoin—making it immune to the inflationary tendencies that plague fiat currencies and all other asset classes. Bitcoin operates on a programmatic, exponentially decreasing supply schedule, enabling its initial distribution, cementing its long term scarcity, and ensuring that as more miners attempt to mine more bitcoin, mining difficulty increases indefinitely to keep the predetermined supply schedule on track.</p><blockquote><p>“There are two common arguments against bitcoin being scarce. I'll distill them down here: <br>It's not scarce because people can still create other currencies<br>It's not scarce because I don't understand fractions"<br>- Phil Geiger</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>“Only 21 million bitcoin will ever exist, and the element of trust is removed from the equation entirely. Bitcoin’s fixed supply is enforced by a network consensus mechanism on a decentralized basis. No one trusts anyone, and everyone enforces the rules independently. As an aggregate of these two functions, bitcoin is becoming the scarcest form of money that has ever existed.”<br>- Parker Lewis in Bitcoin Obsoletes All Other Money</p></blockquote><p>Immutable scarcity is at the core of bitcoin's value proposition as a savings tool. In a world where other assets can be perpetually produced or devalued, bitcoin’s fixed supply offers a permanent solution. Bitcoin's monetary properties align with the economic principle that systems tend to converge on the one most marketable tool as money. Just because something has a scarce supply doesn’t make it valuable. What makes bitcoin valuable is that it is the best money due to its superior monetary properties. </p><p>It is the world’s first perfectly scarce good with sufficient monetary properties. In contrast to all the melting assets people use as savings vehicles today, bitcoin is a deep freeze at absolute zero.</p><p>Parker Lewis explains bitcoin’s credibly enforced fixed supply as well as as anyone in his book, Gradually, Then Suddenly:</p><blockquote><p>Recognize that there is nothing about a blockchain that guarantees a fixed supply, and bitcoin’s supply schedule is not credible because software dictates it be so. Instead, 21 million is only credible because it is governed on a decentralized basis and by an ever increasing number of network participants. 21 million becomes a more credibly fixed number as more individuals participate in consensus, and it ultimately becomes a more reliable constant as each individual controls a smaller and smaller share of the network over time. <br>- Parker Lewis in Bitcoin Obsoletes All Other Money</p></blockquote><p>Money solved the double coincidence of wants—the problem of requiring two people in a barter system to have precisely what the other wants at the same time. In a barter system, if you have apples and want bananas, you must find someone who not only has bananas but also wants your apples. This makes trading incredibly difficult. Money eliminates this issue by acting as one universal tool for trading. The double coincidence of wants problem is solved by individuals within economic systems converging on one best tool to be used as money, and that best tool is now bitcoin. This is objectively true, given its superior monetary properties.</p><figure> <a href="https://bm.b.tc/your-wealth-is-melting-report" ><img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA2MjkxNDQ4MDI5NTIxNjgz/your-wealth-is-melting---newsletter-graphic-1.png" height="300" width="1200"></a> <figcaption><a href="https://bm.b.tc/your-wealth-is-melting-report">Download </a>the full 37-page report "Your Wealth is Melting". <a href="https://bm.b.tc/your-wealth-is-melting-report">Click here.</a></figcaption> </figure> <p>While all value is ultimately derived from the fact that there will only ever be 21 million bitcoin, its improvement on prior money doesn’t stop there: it’s also fungible (no unit of bitcoin can be distinguished from another), portable (it can be moved permissionlessly and globally at very low cost), durable (it’s data that can be physically preserved in many mediums), and divisible (one bitcoin equals 100,000,000 satoshis, allowing bitcoin to be used for commerce at many scales.</p><p>With bitcoin’s superior monetary properties in mind, we can begin to look at the landscape of the market through the lens of bitcoin. Because these properties stand in stark contrast to the properties of every other good, and because monetary systems converge on one money, it’s not only reasonable, but prudent to visualize traditional storeholds of wealth as measured in this superior asset.</p><h2>Your wealth is melting</h2><p>As human ingenuity and technological innovation drives greater efficiency in producing commodities, services, and information, we find that we predominantly save in assets that we, as a society, can create more of. Traditional saving methods, including holding fiat currency, bonds, stocks, gold, and real estate, are all either themselves vulnerable to being increased in quantity or devalued over time or fundamentally linked to assets that can be.</p><p>Of course there are still short, medium, and even longer term profits to be made by investing in various asset classes. How much of a given asset could exist in the world—its supply—is not the only factor affecting its price, even in the long term. However, in a world with bitcoin, we must begin to ask if they might be overvalued in light of their risk-adjusted returns:</p><p>Is holding the US dollar wise when, if there is a 2x increase in the production capacity of CPI goods, the Federal Reserve must respond to that productivity increase by debasing the currency to maintain their 2% inflation target?</p><p>Bonds are simply contracts for a future amount of US Dollars. Is holding a fixed amount of future US Dollars, with added potential default risk, wise when these Dollars will be debased by design as well?</p><p>Is Apple a good long-term storehold of wealth at a 30 P/E ratio (pay $30 for every $1 of annual earnings) when a plethora of consumer technology companies could produce similar devices or disrupt their walled garden ecosystem, diminishing the unique value proposition ultimately shrinking margins and potentially revenue?</p><p>Gold, despite its physical scarcity, is a commodity that could be mined indefinitely with sufficient technology. Is holding it wise when it can be perpetually produced?</p><figure> <a href="https://unchained.com/pricing/?utm_campaign=btcmag-launch" ><img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA2MjQ5OTUzMjc2NzMyNTky/btcmag100_100_off_promo_1200x300.jpg" height="300" width="1200"></a> <figcaption><em>Visit </em><em><a href="https://unchained.com/pricing/?utm_campaign=btcmag-launch">Unchained.com</a></em><em> for $100 off any Unchained financial services product with code “</em><em><a href="https://unchained.com/pricing/?utm_campaign=btcmag-launch">BTCMAG100</a></em><em>”</em></figcaption> </figure> <p>Is investing in an apartment complex a sound long-term store of wealth, considering the potential for real estate market saturation, where the influx of new developments could lead to a commoditized housing market, filled with fierce competition and shrinking rental yield margins?</p><p>All of these investments may be logical for some time, however, on a long enough timeline, they all face the consequences of the innovation trap—their streams of future cash flows or yield can and will be competed away—or their supply can be simply increased—by free market forces. This ruthless competition is part of why we live in a time of such severe financialization: None of these savings vehicles sufficiently preserve your wealth for the long run, so you must hire or become a money manager. </p><p>The promise of bitcoin is that it reintroduces the concept of true savings.</p><blockquote><p>“There is and always has been a fundamental difference between saving and investment; savings are held in the form of monetary assets and investments are savings which are put at risk. The lines may have been blurred as the economic system financialized, but bitcoin will unblur the lines and make the distinction obvious once again. Money with the right incentive structure will overwhelm demand for complex financial assets and debt instruments.”<br>- Parker Lewis in Bitcoin is the Great Definancialization</p></blockquote><p>Once you begin to accept that using traditional assets for long-term savings isn’t wise because bitcoin exists and has a credibly finite supply, bitcoin itself only further illuminates the problem it solves by serving as a constant to measure other asset classes against. When measured in a perfectly scarce asset like bitcoin, the ways the long-term value of all these asset classes is challenged becomes clearer than ever, particularly in an age where production capabilities are rapidly expanding and markets are increasingly global, interconnected, and highly competitive.</p><p>[END EXCERPT.

<![CDATA[ <p><a href="https://www.botanixlabs.xyz/en/home">Botanix Labs</a>, a Bitcoin development startup based in New York and founded at Harvard, has announced a significant funding of $11.5 million in a press release sent to Bitcoin Magazine.</p><p>This funding round, led by prominent investors including UTXO Management, Polychain Capital, Placeholder Capital, Valor Equity Partners, ABCDE, Andrew Kang, Dan Held, Dovey Wan, Eric Wall and others, will fuel the creation of the Spiderchain. Spiderchain claims to be the first Bitcoin-native Layer 2 primitive with full EVM equivalence, envisioned to support a global financial system built on Bitcoin. This funding follows a previous seed series round of $8.5 million in April.</p><p>“Our team at Botanix Labs is driven by the mission of building the infrastructure that supports aglobal financial system running on Bitcoin for the next 100 years,” Willem Schroé, inventorof the Spiderchain and Co-founder of Botanix Labs stated. “The Spiderchain can scale the Bitcoinecosystem to eight billion users and unlock trillions in capital that has sat idle for years.

<![CDATA[ <p>It is often said that Bitcoin allows anyone to be their own bank. If you know anything about Bitcoin’s ethos and underlying tech, you’ve likely heard of this concept before. But do you know exactly how that works and why Bitcoin is more suitable as a store of value than your bank?</p><p>To get the full picture, it’s important to understand how banks work today, and how Bitcoin differs from the traditional financial system. </p><h2>The Problem With Banks</h2><p>The first problem with banks is their custodial nature, and with that, the risk of rehypothecation inherent to fractional reserve banking. If banks were simply means of warehousing cash for their clients, using them would only imply <em>counterparty risk. </em>While not ideal, this would not necessarily be a problem if banks simply let customer funds sit there, but that’s not exactly what happens. To explain, banks lend your hard-earned cash, often purchasing government bonds to collect a yield on that cash. Sometimes, a bank might lend out too much and not maintain enough liquidity to honor redemptions, and unfortunately, there’s nothing you can do about it. If the bank goes down, often, your funds go along with it.</p><p>Not only that, but the traditional financial world is gatekept. Put simply, traditional financial institutions must adhere to national and local regulations that place restrictions on how individuals can use their hard-earned currency. This problem is exacerbated in countries with strict capital controls. If government regulation can change at the drop of a hat, your funds in a bank can be put at risk. Banks and traditional financial institutions, existing at the grace of their government’s legal and regulatory system, have no choice but to comply.</p><p>In either of these situations, you’d lose out through no fault of your own. Your funds rely entirely on the bank’s integrity. This is a big risk. Banks have failed before and they will fail again. Unfortunately, centralized financial institutions just come with these types of risks. </p><h2>Why is Bitcoin the Solution</h2><p>To avoid this uncertainty, you want to store capital outside the jurisdiction of centralized entities. The only answer is to use a purely decentralized store of value, i.e. Bitcoin. Bitcoin circumvents these risks with a few features that centralized financial institutions cannot offer. </p><h3>Borderless</h3><p>Unlike banks, Bitcoin is borderless. You can access and use your funds in any country, and you can send BTC to anyone around the world. The beauty of borderlessness is that it doesn’t cost you anything more to send BTC to your next-door neighbor than it would to send it to someone on the other side of the world. Plus, unlike banks, currency exchange fees aren’t necessary. In addition, users can transact across political jurisdictions seamlessly due to the permissionlss nature of Bitcoin.</p><h3>Peer-to-peer transfer of value</h3><p>A key difference between the traditional financial system and Bitcoin is the former’s requirement of trusted third parties that facilitate transactions. This implies that a third party can approve or deny a given transaction, stymying an individual's expression of financial agency. In contrast, Bitcoin’s permissionless peer-to-peer network sidesteps intermediaries, allowing individuals to unilaterally dictate transactions between each other.</p><h3>Ownership</h3><p>An additional benefit of Bitcoin is the ability for individuals to control their funds through the power of cryptography. In essence, if someone has access to a given Bitcoin private key, they can control the flow of funds from public addresses associated with that private key.</p><p>As long as no one has access to your private keys, only you can control your Bitcoin. While there are challenges when it comes to privately and safely storing your <a href="https://www.ledger.com/academy/whats-a-private-key">private key</a> (generated from a <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/the-infosec-basics-how-to-keep-your-bitcoin-seed-phrase-secure">seed phrase</a>), you can securely use this private key to sign messages and interact with the Bitcoin network. While storing funds in a bank account allows the bank to lend out or use your funds, that’s not possible with a non-custodial Bitcoin wallet. That’s what true ownership is all about.</p><h2>To Be Truly Bankless, How You Manage Your Bitcoin Matters </h2><p>If you want to go truly bankless, it’s important to understand the cross-over of traditional financial institutions and centralized bitcoin custodians.</p><p>Centralized exchanges are businesses registered in specific countries. As such, they must comply with local laws and regulations, just like banks. Plus, they don’t allow you to manage your own private keys. The company can access your bitcoin at any time, just like a bank can with your fiat currency.</p><p>Any of these centralized institutions rely on the integrity of the banks they use. They all involve counterparty risk. If you use a crypto platform that relies on a bank, and the bank goes down, your funds go along with it. So, if you’re dead set on going bankless, make sure you take these aspects into account.</p><h2>Challenges On The Road To Banklessness</h2><p>To go bankless with Bitcoin, you know you need to embrace self-custody, but custody isn’t the only challenge. Of course, Bitcoin works a little differently from fiat currencies, so truly going Bankless with Bitcoin also has its challenges.</p><h3>Everyday Payments</h3><p>Bitcoin’s suitability as a store of value is unmatched, but it can offer a challenge for everyday payments. Bitcoin’s average block time is 10 minutes – meaning that a simple payment for an item like a cup of coffee is heavily constrained by Bitcoin’s design.</p><p>That said, there are solutions to scale both Bitcoin’s transaction speed and total throughput. For example, the Lightning network, a <a href="https://www.ledger.com/academy/bitcoin-layer-2s-what-they-are-and-how-they-work">Bitcoin Layer 2 solution</a>, provides near-instant and global final settlement of transactions while minimizing the use of the Bitcoin base layer. While Lightning is constrained by certain aspects of its design, like needing to settle on Bitcoin itself to close and open payment channels, Layer 2s like Lightning network open up the possibility of greatly scaling Bitcoin’s use as a medium of exchange.</p><p>One proposal to overcome the Lightning Network’s design constraints, as mentioned above, is the use of Chaumian ecash, where federated mints can issue redeemable certificates to users in the way that cash was at one point, a certificate of deposit redeemable for gold.</p><p>In an ecash implementation, a network of federated mints would use Lightning to settle between each other, and retail payments would take place using ecash itself. This implies that Lightning may become more of a commercial solution for scaling Bitcoin financial services, and that retail payments would take place on solutions built on top of Lightning.</p><h3>Widespread Adoption</h3><p>Of course, it’s impossible to truly go bankless with Bitcoin if it is not accepted as a medium of exchange. For now, businesses that accept bitcoin are still in the minority in most places around the world. At first, you might be searching for in-person and online shops willing to take cryptocurrencies. </p><p>However, bitcoin adoption is changing significantly. While Bitcoin is still a teenager, countless big brands accept Bitcoin today. Disney, Playstation, Microsoft, Starbucks, KFC, Burger King: the list of Bitcoin-friendly businesses is only increasing.</p><h2>Your Road To Banklessness</h2><p>In conclusion, going bankless with Bitcoin involves due diligence. For starters, you need a non-custodial wallet such as a Ledger device. But going truly bankless doesn’t end there. You must assess the platforms you use and how you use them. And finally, you must put measures in place to make your everyday transactions more feasible. </p><p>But, with those pieces in place, you're well on your way to fina</p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ <p>Metaplanet, a decades-old Japanese Public company providing hospitality and technology-related services, recently announced a <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/the-next-microstrategy-japanese-public-company-is-buying-bitcoin">major strategic pivot</a> - embracing Bitcoin as a core corporate treasury asset.</p><p>Last month, <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/asias-microstrategy-metaplanet-buys-1-billion-bitcoin-yen">Metaplanet revealed</a> it acquired over $6 million worth of Bitcoin, marking the company's foray into digital assets. This mirrors <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/tags/microstrategy">MicroStrategy's</a> pioneering move to allocate part of its reserves to Bitcoin starting in 2020.</p><p>Following the news, Metaplanet has <a href="https://x.com/Metaplanet_JP/status/1787717171629408637">recently hired</a> leading industry analyst <a href="https://twitter.com/DylanLeClair_">Dylan LeClair</a> as Director of Bitcoin Strategy to accelerate its new Bitcoin focus. LeClair is head of market research for Bitcoin Magazine and UTXO Management, and is respected for his expertise in on-chain analytics and macroeconomics.</p><p>At Metaplanet, LeClair will craft the corporate Bitcoin strategy, using public markets tools to accumulate BTC for the balance sheet. This aligns with Metaplanet's vision for advancing Bitcoin's role in its balance sheet.</p><p>LeClair commented: "I'm extremely excited to be joining Metaplenat to implement a corporate Bitcoin standard. By leveraging various corporate financial strategies, we aim to further establish a blueprint for corporate Bitcoin adoption in Japan and beyond."</p><p>He added, "Metaplanet seeks to highlight the strategic benefits of adopting Bitcoin, particularly in regions where political currencies face heightened structural weaknesses."</p><p>Metaplanet is positioning itself as a "MicroStrategy of Asia," mimicking the software firm's approach to strengthening its balance sheet with Bitcoin.<br><br>MicroStrategy holds over $10 billion in BTC reserves, a strategy that increased its enterprise value considerably.</p><figure> <a href="https://bm.b.tc/unchained-bmag-dot-com" ><img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA0MzE5MTg5MTE1NDc5NDkz/bm-x-unchained-article-cta---learn-more.png" height="507" width="1200"></a> <figcaption><em>Click the image to learn more.</em></figcaption> </figure> <p>Sora Ventures' Jason Fang called Metaplanet "Asia's first MicroStrategy." The move also enables Japanese investors to gain Bitcoin exposure without paying capital gains taxes, which can reach 55% in the country.</p><p>Metaplanet offers a path for public market investors and institutions to invest in Bitcoin. This is a major development as corporate Bitcoin adoption goes mainstream.</p><p>If Metaplanet follows MicroStrategy's playbook, significantly increasing BTC reserves over time, it could provide meaningful upside for investors and validation for Bitcoin.</p><p><em>Bitcoin Magazine is wholly owned by BTC Inc., which operates </em><a href="https://www.utxo.management/portfolio/"><em>UTXO Management</em></a><em>, a regulated capital allocator focused on the digital assets industry.

The next question becomes whether to use a <a href="https://unchained.com/features/singlesig-vs-multisig/?utm_campaign=btcmag-launch">singlesig wallet or a multisig wallet</a>.<br><br>If you <a href="https://unchained.com/features/what-is-multisig/?utm_campaign=btcmag-launch">choose to use multisig</a> to secure your long-term savings, you will also need to decide whether you want to set it up all by yourself, or in collaboration with others. Both of these approaches have their own set of trade-offs, and in this article we will compare and contrast them.</p><h2>Do-it-yourself (DIY) multisig</h2><p>An attractive characteristic of bitcoin is that it allows people to become more self-sovereign with their wealth. If you’re someone who emphasizes the importance of this feature, your initial reaction to collaborative custody multisig may be one of skepticism. You might instead be considering setting up multisig by yourself, without involving anyone else in your arrangement.</p><figure> <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA2MjQ5NDM5NzU5NzcwODAw/64f87253e0c93daaacf96768_multisig-image-7.svg" height="623" width="1200"> <figcaption>The most common DIY multisig setup involves using multiple keys from hardware wallets you control</figcaption> </figure> <p>A multisig wallet can be set up by using one of several free and open source wallet softwares, such as <a href="https://unchained-capital.github.io/caravan/#/?utm_campaign=btcmag-launch">Caravan</a>, <a href="https://sparrowwallet.com/">Sparrow Wallet</a>, or <a href="https://electrum.org/">Electrum</a>. They allow you to combine extended public keys (xpubs) to build the multisig quorum you want. This approach has a couple of advantages—it gives you the opportunity to customize the structure to suit your needs and potentially retain more privacy than collaborative multisig.</p><h2>Collaborative custody multisig</h2><p>Although “collaborative custody” may seem like an alternative to self-custody, these labels are not mutually exclusive. In a thoughtfully designed multisig structure, both terms can accurately describe the same situation.<br><br>Bitcoin self-custody is typically defined by who possesses the power to spend the bitcoin. If you hold bitcoin in self-custody, then you’re the only one with unilateral power to spend your bitcoin. Collaborative custody means you're collaborating with another party to help you manage or spend the bitcoin. In a <a href="https://unchained.com/features/what-is-multisig/?utm_campaign=btcmag-launch">2-of-3 multisig</a> where you hold two keys and a collaborative partner holds one key, both features are available! You can still move your bitcoin without relying on the collaborative partner, but you can also receive assistance from them when needed. Additionally, your collaborative partner cannot move your bitcoin without your consent.</p><figure> <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA2MjQ5NDM5NzU5NzA1ODc1/64f872c17660b5df5c0180d1_multisig-image-8.svg" height="622" width="1200"> <figcaption>The most common collaborative multisig setup involves using a keys from hardware wallets you control and a partner who controls a minority of keys.</figcaption> </figure> <p>Collaborative custody multisig can be set up with two or more people. If you have someone in your life that is technical and trustworthy, you could work with that person to set up collaborative custody. However, the most popular approach is to form a partnership with a business that specializes in collaborative multisig. Choosing an established company with a great reputation will grant you access to a team of experts you can trust for help, without giving up control over your bitcoin.<br><br>If you work with one or more collaborative <a href="https://unchained.com/blog/what-is-a-bitcoin-key-agent/?utm_campaign=btcmag-launch">key agents</a>, you will simplify your setup by reducing the number of items you need to keep track of yourself. The partnership can also provide you with a resource to help you think through wallet maintenance, such as retaining the wallet configuration information, re-securing your bitcoin if a key becomes lost or compromised, navigating technical difficulties, and <a href="https://unchained.com/blog/what-is-a-utxo-bitcoin/?utm_campaign=btcmag-launch">managing UTXOs</a>. An institutional collaborative partner can provide the added benefit of actively monitoring for any suspicious activity in connection with your bitcoin wallet, as well.</p><h2>Trade-offs</h2><h3>Privacy</h3><p>As mentioned previously, collaborative custody will typically involve sharing some information with your collaborative partner about your bitcoin. This is necessary to get the most value and support out of the relationship.<br><br>In most cases, your collaborative partner will be able to see your bitcoin balance, and observe the <a href="https://unchained.com/blog/what-is-a-bitcoin-address/?utm_campaign=btcmag-launch">bitcoin addresses</a> that you interact with while sending and receiving bitcoin. This is why you should only ever consider collaborative partnerships with people or businesses you can trust to respect your privacy.<br><br>At Unchained, we are transparent about this reality. The privacy of our clients is taken seriously, and you can <a href="https://unchained.com/privacy/?utm_campaign=btcmag-launch">view the details of our privacy policy here</a>.</p><h3>Ease of setup and operation</h3><p>The biggest downside to attempting multisig on your own is the lack of reliable technical support available for you and your beneficiaries. Multisig is more involved than singlesig, and has several components that must be properly managed. Otherwise, you might find yourself in a difficult situation when trying to access your bitcoin in the future.</p><figure> <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA2MjQ5NDY3Njc2OTkyNjg4/btcmag100_100_off_promo_1200x300-1.jpg" height="300" width="1200"> <figcaption><em>Visit </em><em><a href="https://unchained.com/pricing/?utm_campaign=btcmag-launch">Unchained.com</a></em><em> for $100 off any Unchained financial services product with code “</em><em><a href="https://unchained.com/pricing/?utm_campaign=btcmag-launch">BTCMAG100</a></em><em>”</em></figcaption> </figure> <p>For example, you will need to know a little about <a href="https://unchained.com/blog/the-ticket-to-understanding-extended-public-keys/?utm_campaign=btcmag-launch">xpubs</a> and BIP 32 derivation paths to understand the specifics about how your multisig wallet is configured. This information can be found in a wallet descriptor or <a href="https://unchained.com/blog/what-is-a-multisig-wallet-configuration-file/?utm_campaign=btcmag-launch">wallet configuration file</a>, which is an important item you will be responsible for keeping in your possession. If this file is lost, then you are at risk of losing access to the bitcoin in your multisig wallet, <em>even if you still have a controlling number of keys within the multisig quorum</em>.<br></p><figure> <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA2MjQ5NDM5NzU5ODM2MzM2/6437be4fc524924ce9f46c30_group-2085662339.png" height="800" width="676"> <figcaption>A partner like Unchained can help you recover your bitcoin as long as you have access to at least one of your keys.</figcaption> </figure> <p>Additionally, with an abundance of bitcoin software and hardware designed by various parties, you may run into occasional interoperability issues that can be confusing and frustrating to navigate. These bumps in the road are not uncommon while using bitcoin, and multisig can add another layer of complexity. If you aren’t very technical, or confident about the mechanics of bitcoin and multisig, you may need to rely on outside assistance in these situations. Without an established collaborative partnership, you may be vulnerable to receiving incorrect (or even malicious) advice.</p><h3>Spending convenience</h3><p>If you want to get the most out of multisig, then you’ll want to geographically separate the keys. Keeping the keys together in the same location would resemble a more cumbersome version of singlesig. Separating the keys is what adds security and removes single points of failure, but it will also mean that it’s less convenient to make a withdrawal.<br><br>If you operate a multisig wallet on your own and separate the keys, then you will have to travel to different locations in order to take any bitcoin out of your wallet. This might not seem like a big deal, if you are holding your bitcoin savings for the long term, and have no plans for regular withdrawals. However, you could still be put into a difficult position if a situation occurred where you needed to access your bitcoin, but your movement was restricted due to unforeseen circumstances, such as a local crisis.<br><br>If you use a collaborative custody setup, such as a 2-of-3 quorum where you keep one key at home, one key away from home, and a key agent partner holds the third key, then you have an avenue to accessing your bitcoin that doesn’t require travel. You can sign a withdrawal using your key at home and call upon your collaborative partner to use their key, so that your bitcoin can be spent more conveniently.</p><h3>Inheritance</h3><p>Even if you are personally confident with the technology behind bitcoin and multisig wallets, a concern might be inheritance. If you want your beneficiaries to have access to your bitcoin in the event of your death or incapacitation, and they are not as familiar with bitcoin as you are, it can be challenging to find a good solution.<br><br>In a DIY multisig setup, creating functional instructions for your loved ones on how to find your multiple, separate keys and recover your bitcoin is not always as simple as it sounds, especially if you want to leave no room for error. Your loved one will need to know how to access and use your wallet configuration file, find your multiple seed phrases and load them into one or more hardware wallets, and use those devices to perform signatures for the withdrawal.</p><figure> <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA2MjQ5NDM5NzU5OTAxODcy/652ea9b984a70f20367c02e4_group-2085662363.svg" height="800" width="564"> <figcaption>Unchained trust or personal vaults combined with the inheritance protocol ensure that your heirs can recover your bitcoin without learning technical skills today.</figcaption> </figure> <p>Collaborative custody can make for a much smoother experience. Since your collaborative partner will typically have the wallet configuration file, one of the keys in a standard 2-of-3 quorum, and the technical expertise required for recovery, your executor or trustee will barely need to do any work at all. As long as they can access just one of your seed phrases, and they also understand they are supposed to reach out to your collaborative partner in the event of your demise, they wouldn’t need to know any additional details about how bitcoin works! Your collaborative partner could simply instruct your executor or trustee on how to load the seed phrase into a signing device and sign a transaction to move your bitcoin to the wallets of your beneficiaries.</p><p>For example, in the case of Unchained, <a href="https://unchained.com/blog/unchained-inheritance-protocol/?utm_campaign=btcmag-launch">our Inheritance Protocol</a> guides the user through everything they need to know for setting up simple and secure recovery. Our model makes it easy to safely transfer possession of your bitcoin to beneficiaries designated by a will or trust.</p><h4>Access to financial services</h4><p>One unique advantage of collaborative custody institutions is that they can grant you easy access to other bitcoin financial services. Besides inheritance, this could include <a href="https://unchained.com/bitcoin-ira">retirement</a>, <a href="https://unchained.com/trading-desk">trading</a>, <a href="https://unchained.com/loans">loans</a>, or <a href="https://unchained.com/business">other business needs</a>. If you don’t have a collaborative custody partner, you may be able to find companies that offer some of these services in the context of bitcoin. However, there is an important difference.<br><br>Collaborative custody institutions have a vested interest in a long-term relationship, because you can use your keys to permissionlessly withdraw your funds and exit the partnership at any time. Your collaborative partner can do nothing to stop this, other than provide high quality services to maintain your desire for the partnership to continue.<br><br>Other business models will not necessarily have your best interests in mind. As witnessed in recent years, many large bitcoin exchanges and lending services have demonstrated a shortsighted approach, treating client funds with gross negligence, even to the point of losing peoples' bitcoin with little opportunity for recourse. The principles of self-custody and low time-preference relationships are what can help protect you from these kinds of breaches of trust.</p><figure> <a href="https://unchained.com/pricing/?utm_campaign=btcmag-launch" ><img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA2MjQ5NDY3Njc2OTkyNjg4/btcmag100_100_off_promo_1200x300-1.jpg" height="300" width="1200"></a> <figcaption><em>Visit </em><em><a href="https://unchained.com/pricing/?utm_campaign=btcmag-launch">Unchained.com</a></em><em> for $100 off any Unchained financial services product with code “</em><em><a href="https://unchained.com/pricing/?utm_campaign=btcmag-launch">BTCMAG100</a></em><em>”</em></figcaption> </figure> <h2>Comparison chart</h2><p>Bringing back the chart from <a href="https://unchained.com/features/singlesig-vs-multisig/?utm_campaign=btcmag-launch">our article comparing singlesig wallets to multisig wallets</a> and highlighting the sections that focus on DIY multisig and collaborative multisig, we can observe the main differences in these models.<br><br>Although you may give up some privacy, collaborative custody can simplify the process of setting up your wallet, operating it securely, and building a functional inheritance plan.

<![CDATA[ <p>You know how the dodo bird became extinct? It became too fat to fly. </p><p>In fact, the name ‘dodo’ likely originated from the Portuguese word, ‘simpleton’. The dodo bird lived very comfortably for much of its existence on an isolated island that lacked any natural predators. Over time the dodo bird grew bigger, and its wings grew smaller. Growing larger while having no predators emboldened the mighty dodo bird to become increasingly fearless. </p><p>And then humans showed up. And everything changed. Instantly. </p><p>The rapid and dramatic environmental changes left the dodo bird helpless. Because it was flightless, it couldn’t escape. It needed wings to survive but evolutionary processes don’t occur overnight, they take thousands of years. From happy, fat, and thriving to extinction. In the blink of an eye. </p><p>That’s the harsh reality of evolutionary biology – it only optimizes based on the past and present, never the future. Evolution is a reactive process. Environments can increase a species’ resiliency over time, or it can change so rapidly that it rids itself of them completely. </p><h2>Bitcoin in its current state is a dodo bird. </h2><p>The evolutionary checkpoints for money are universally understood as:</p><p>1) Store of Value: you can preserve purchasing power with it</p><p>2) Medium of Exchange: you can use it to buy and sell things</p><p>3) Unit of Account: you can use it to measure the value of other things</p><p>Bitcoin is firmly sitting on first base regardless of what its lazy critics claim. Price volatility does not negate the store of value property and there is no question that most current bitcoin adoption is related to saving. Bitcoin as a medium of exchange is a work in progress as the reality is very few users are engaging in any kind of commerce with it. </p><p>If bitcoin is only capable of serving as a store of value and nothing more, then it cannot become money. Aspiring to be the best store of value is aspiring to be a fat flightless bird. Bitcoin is on a lonely island of less than 2% global adoption, emboldened by price appreciation, with no concern of outside predators as glowing endorsements roll in from Wall Street – flourishing and unbothered like the dodo bird.</p><p>“Like you said, evolution takes time! Bitcoin will become a medium of exchange and later a unit of account. It’s just too early right now but it <em>will happen eventually</em>.”</p><p>Will it? Why is bitcoin as a medium of exchange a foregone conclusion?</p><p>Put down the orange pom poms and look around today. Bitcoin’s current landscape has it waddling down a path that leads to nothing more than becoming a captured amorphous digital property token. The lack of situational awareness and adversarial thinking amongst bitcoiners is at embarrassingly all-time lows and seemingly getting worse the further bitcoin sleepwalks towards stasis. </p><p>If it’s not clear to you, let me wake you from this slumber so you better see the signposts: </p><h2>Signpost #1: Stablecoins</h2><p>Remember the bitcoin rallying cry, ‘separate money from state’? If you’ve forgotten it, then it’s hard to blame you with the amount of self-described bitcoin maximalists head-scratchingly rallying behind stablecoins at worst and apologizing for them at best.</p><p><em>“Bitcoin is too volatile!” </em></p><p><em>“The global south!” </em></p><p>And my personal favorite, <em>“Stablecoins are a gateway to bitcoin!”</em>. Hard to say that with a straight face.</p><p>Here’s the wakeup call. Stablecoins are fiat money. They are a gateway to fiat money. They are an adaptation of everything bitcoin was designed to escape from. They are bitcoin’s biggest sheep in wolf’s clothing competitor. Full stop. They mostly run on Ethereum and Tron. If people want to use them that’s totally fine – but enough with pretending that stablecoins complement bitcoin in any constructive way. </p><p>Do you think the US Treasury is going to just idly sit by without sinking their talons into these stablecoins? The path of least resistance for the government to introduce a CBDC is to simply regulate stablecoin issuers with an iron fist. Their money, their rules. </p><p>What happens when we’ve sleepily conceded bitcoin’s medium-of-exchange evolution phase to heavily regulated stablecoins? Will people suddenly become enlightened and retreat to bitcoin overnight? It’s a warm and fuzzy thought until you consider that the government would unquestionably restrict stablecoins being exchanged for bitcoin. Their money, their rules.</p><p>And what’s to stop stablecoins from covering so much surface area as a medium of exchange that it never concedes any ground? Gresham’s Law posits that “bad money drives out good” which means people tend to spend the bad money and save the good money. However, in absence of legal tender laws, Thiers’ Law comes into play where “good money drives out bad” as the superior form of money is naturally preferred. If we abdicate bitcoin as a medium-of-exchange to stablecoins, then what incentives will there ever be to scale bitcoin as a medium-of-exchange? Gresham’s Law will take root and Thiers’ Law will be little more than an idealist fantasy relegated to underground markets and fringe circular economies. </p><p>“The market is signaling they prefer stablecoins for spending.”</p><p>This isn’t pearl clutching over the market being wrong. It’s an ominous warning that bitcoin’s destiny is not written in stone. If it is never optimized to be used as a medium of exchange, it will never be used as a medium of exchange. If we are not relentless in our pursuit to advance bitcoin’s monetary evolution, then it will not happen. </p><h2>Signpost #2: Bitcoin ETFs</h2><p>Wall Street’s foray into bitcoin was an inevitability at some point in its life cycle. But what is striking is how quickly Wall Street arrived (less than 15 years of bitcoin’s existence) and the velocity of their entrance (daily trading volume in the billions of dollars). While today many bitcoiners applaud the new Bitcoin ETFs as a welcomed milestone for the ‘normalization’ of bitcoin, down the road this likely plays out differently from what they hope.</p><p>“Now that bitcoin is mainstream and in people’s retirement accounts, the government will never be able to ban it. It will be too politically untenable.” </p><p>A comment <em>almost</em> as ridiculous as thinking stablecoins are a gateway to bitcoin. </p><p>There’s not much debate that it is more convenient to purchase a Bitcoin ETF than it is to self-custody your own bitcoin. Market forces always compel people to seek the most convenient solution, especially when they have no consideration for the associated tradeoffs. </p><p>The hard pill to swallow is the fact that most people are not interested in self-sovereignty. They don’t want to become their own bank. And no, they don’t want to hear your long winded histrionic about fiat currency. </p><p>It boils down to: </p><p>1) Click a few buttons in my retirement account?</p><p>or</p><p>2) Go through a KYC/AML process on an unfamiliar bitcoin exchange, buy an unfamiliar hardware device, research how self-custody works, safeguard and manage private keys, etc.</p><p>If self-sovereignty disinterests you and all you want is bitcoin exposure – it’s a no brainer. You choose Option 1. And over time what this looks like is the next wave of adopters will seek exposure through ETFs – not taking direct custody of bitcoin themselves. Admittedly this concern doesn’t exist for the parts of the world that lack access to US financial markets – however allow me to point back to Signpost #1: stablecoins. The global south will seek refuge in stablecoins before pursuing bitcoin. The dollar isn’t hyperinflating any time soon and those who claim it will have been wrong on that call now for decades. </p><p>Now play this out. The next broad wave of adopters buying a financial product accelerating the amount of bitcoin held by the most regulated institutions on the planet. </p><p>The act of self-custodying bitcoin will be reduced to a suspicious and odd exercise. </p><p>“That’s weird. Nobody uses it as money. What’s the point of holding it yourself?” </p><p>And as the coffers of regulated custodians fill up with bitcoin supply, the surface attack density for those who self-custody will increase. And increase. </p><p>Financial institutions will not rally behind the self-sovereign bitcoiner. They do not care that the entire purpose of bitcoin was to disintermediate trusted third parties (i.e. literally them). In fact, their financial incentives are such that they have minimal interest in supporting self-custody as they make money on you giving your bitcoin to them. When the time is right, they are more likely to lobby against self-custody than to support it. And that time is when there are enough bitcoiners whose sole exposure is through these ETF’s and consequently wouldn’t care about defending the right to self-custody. Remember, you’re the weird one now doing it the <em>wrong way</em>.</p><p>This isn’t conjecture; self-custody is already under attack. The self-sovereign bitcoiner will become low hanging fruit. And saying you lost your bitcoin in a “boating accident” when you’ve purchased all your bitcoin on a KYC exchange is going to do you as much good as the dodo bird’s stubby wings. </p><h2>Signpost #3: Ossification</h2><p>The race for monetary supremacy is in full force. Where are we at? Stablecoins are dominating bitcoin as a medium of exchange and ETFs already hold close to 5% of total bitcoin supply in less than three months of trading.</p><p>Cool. So what are we doing about it? The price of bitcoin as a representation of purchasing power is paramount but it has become a sedative for adversarial thinking. Don’t get it twisted – the bitcoin price is a magnet, not a shield. As the price climbs so will the insatiable desire from governments to capture it. Do you think they will just let you opt out and ride into the sunset so easily? Oh, you sweet, summer child. </p><p>Sedated by paper gains, a non-insignificant amount of drawbridge bitcoiners are advocating for bitcoin’s ossification. Bitcoin, which <em>*checks notes*</em> is supposed to be money, is still not yet a medium of exchange, but is now somehow good enough as-is?</p><p>I’m willing to acknowledge that there are probably well-intentioned bitcoiners in the ossification camp who simply believe bitcoin can only be destroyed from within via protocol changes and that the battles to come can be won with bitcoin as it exists today. I’d respond to such line of reasoning with a quote from Sun Tzu, </p><p><em>“Victorious warriors win first and then go to war, while defeated warriors go to war first and then seek to win."</em> </p><p>Put simply – you do not win battles without preparation. Failing to plan is planning to fail. Bitcoin has not won. There’s less than 2% adoption globally and the wolves are at the door. Bitcoin hasn’t even surpassed the market cap of Amazon and you want to spike the football? </p><p>And for those in the pro-ossification camp purely out of selfish motivations because you got your bag and you’re just biding time to dump it later – are you certain it will be that easy? Wouldn’t your motivations be better served if bitcoin didn’t become low hanging fruit for government capture? Do you think in an increasingly adversarial environment, with no vibrant bitcoin circular economy, you will just be able to unload your stack on Coinbase sight unseen, no questions asked? Woof. </p><p>Scaling and enhancing bitcoin in a judicious manner so that it can mature into a medium of exchange should be paramount to bitcoiners. No, this is not a torn page from the big block, “buy a coffee with bitcoin” because “babies are dying”, playbook. The security and decentralization of the base layer is a non-negotiable primitive. You cannot have sturdy money on a wobbly base. However, we cannot be complacent with settling on bitcoin as just a store of value and then idly hope it becomes a medium of exchange when there is a dearth of layer two solutions beyond the Lightning Network which isn’t without its own limitations. </p><p>The introduction of ordinals has been a hotly contested cultural topic amongst different factions in bitcoin. The entire debate can be synthesized down to monetary maximalism (money only) vs platform maximalism (anything within consensus rules is okay). The debate is held at the margins and the overwhelmingly silent majority doesn’t really care for three main reasons:</p><p>1) they hardly know what ordinals are because it is such a niche subsection within bitcoin’s ecosystem</p><p>2) ordinals in their current format is just repackaged tech for people to gamble and engage in financial nihilism</p><p>3) bitcoin is still working just fine</p><p>The silent majority reaches the appropriate logical conclusion that expending mental bandwidth fretting over something that cannot be stopped and that doesn’t even hinder their ability to use bitcoin, is an utterly meaningless exercise in futility and virtue signaling.</p><p>The blind spot for the anti-ordinals crowd is the severe lack of introspection regarding the available block space due to a lack of ‘honest’ financial transactions. The pro-ordinals crowd doesn’t even dispute that all use cases other than bitcoin as money are unquestionably subordinate. People are inscribing nonsense because the barrier to entry is low enough to do so. </p><p>Every bitcoiner needs to eat this slice of humble pie: the apex use case for bitcoin is currently competing for block space with digital beanie babies. </p><p>Philosopher Epictetus said, “If you wish to be a writer, write.” The question we need to be asking is not “How do we stop the digital beanie babies?” it should be, “What are we doing to propagate more financial transactions?”</p><p>Unfortunately, the emotional response to ordinals comes with a call for ossification. Rather than harness the courage of a stoic competitor, some would rather take the ball and go home. For them, the specter of unforeseen consequences outweighs the benefits of bitcoin becoming money. The irony is that ossification kneecaps bitcoin such that it will become ensnared as only a store of value. No medium of exchange just means more available block space to incubate other arbitrary use cases. </p><p>Don’t like ordinals? Use bitcoin.</p><h2>Sign Post #4: “Don’t spend your bitcoin”</h2><p>There is a steadily repeating mantra amongst the bitcoin intelligentsia that you should not spend your bitcoin. “Savings technology”, “pristine asset”, “Buying land in Manhattan 100 years ago”, “store of value”, “Buy it and don’t touch it for 10 years”, etc. These are the prevailing bitcoinisms indoctrinating the latest waves of bitcoin adopters. The introductory value system individuals adopt when first arriving to bitcoin is demonstrably impermeable. Each cultural skirmish in bitcoin’s chronology is heavily influenced by whatever prevailing narrative surrounded bitcoin at the time they first became a user. It’s no coincidence that the existing ordinals squabble is a divide comprised mostly of longtime versus newer bitcoiners. People’s understanding of bitcoin is heavily influenced at the onset. If what they hear is “don’t spend your bitcoin” it reinforces the notion that bitcoin isn’t really money. Paring this with an explanation that bitcoin as a medium of exchange will happen at some point in the distant future, only perpetuates the falsehood that bitcoin is inevitable so there is no motivation for any change. Secure your bag and let some faceless future generation figure it out, eh?</p><p>Bitcoiners can agree to be disagreeable but can we at least agree to stop telling people what to do with their bitcoin? It’s supposed to be money. Do whatever you want with it. Don’t allow your actions to be enslaved by dogmatic rhetoric. Freedom money does not come with instructions. </p><h2>Now what?</h2><p>This isn’t a thesis to advocate for any specific BIP or scaling solution. It is a bucket of cold water to implore bitcoiners to have some self-awareness of the current path bitcoin is taking. Bitcoin is just software. What it eventually becomes is based on how users interact with the software. There is nothing inherent within the software that preordains bitcoin to become money. That outcome is completely dependent on the users – if they want it. </p><p>The dodo bird didn’t need wings – until it did. We can submit ourselves to the laws of evolutionary biology, do nothing, and see how this all plays out. Or we can do what the dodo bird couldn’t – adapt with foresight. Bitcoin does not win or reach escape velocity as solely a store of value. It is the foundation, not the destination. In the race for monetary supremacy, there is nothing the competition would want more than for bitcoin to stagnate as a store of value. </p><p>Because it’s at that point bitcoin will have become too fat to fly. </p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ <p>A little under a year ago, I <a href="https://twitter.com/bergealex4/status/1674454861096660998">announced on Twitter</a> the idea of the Bitcoin Script Project. To say it was well received would be an understatement. Bitcoiners were craving something they could hang onto in the middle of the bear. Glimmers of hope were on the horizon and I intended to magnify those and hopefully rally the industry around a new technological narrative. Unfortunately, life had other plans and, to make a long story short, I quickly realized I bit off more than I could chew at the time. </p><p>The Bitcoin Script Project never saw the light of the day. At best, it was a short-lived social awareness campaign. It seeded some ideas and moved the conversation forward. At the very least, it’s probably why I have the privilege of working on this column today. I bring this up because my experience is no different than the one of hundreds of individual who have tried to leave their mark on Bitcoin. It’s a humbling and thankless affair. Bruised egos are commonplace. Many have left far more blood, sweat, and tears than I have on this front. </p><p>Every once in a while though, stars align and our collective actions start transcending each individual’s own interests. You see, Bitcoin moves at its own rhythm. Try to push the pace and the whole dance is thrown off. This synchronization act requires serious patience. </p><p>Last week, just as the walls appeared to be closing in, the dance company finally got its act together. And it was beautiful. After a long hiatus, optimism is back and has finally shaken off the fear, uncertainty, and doubt. The opportunity ahead has galvanized the developer community to undertake perhaps its most ambitious work yet.</p><h2>Make Script Great Again</h2><p>As I entered the halls of the Palmer Events Center in Austin on Wednesday morning, it was hard to ignore the flashbacks from days long gone. <br><br>Back in 2015, an eerily similar event took place in Montreal, Canada, and set the tone for the next decade. <a href="https://montreal2015.scalingbitcoin.org/">Scaling Bitcoin</a> came at a critical junction in the project’s history – just as the community struggled to define its vision for the future. The event was a who’s who of a then young, nascent industry. The entirety of Bitcoin’s figurative brain under one roof. Scary, in hindsight.</p><p>I digress, but <a href="https://btcplusplus.dev/conf/atx24#agenda">Bitcoin++</a> last week had similar vibes. You could tell right away there was a special energy in the building and the crowd was no less stellar. A stark contrast from the average conference roadshow and the online antics we’ve become accustomed to. </p><p>No billboards, no 280-character tirades, and most importantly, no sales pitch.</p><p>At the onset of the conference, it was hard to ignore the momentum behind the OP_CAT proposal. Its staunchest proponents were likely preparing for the event to be its consecration. Rough consensus appeared within reach and even those who had originally dismissed it were coming around to the idea.</p><p>As fate would have it, at least one person had other plans, and in the first few minutes of his presentation, the implications dawned on everyone present. </p><p>"<a href="https://t.co/tQJQoWepcK">The Great Script Restoration Project</a>" is Blockstream developer Rusty Russell’s attempt to flip the proverbial script on everyone. It’s a journey to contemplate the “why” behind the kerfuffle of script and covenant proposals thrown around these days. What are we trying to achieve? </p><p>How about fixing Bitcoin script and returning it to its former glory?</p><p>For context, a significant portion of Bitcoin’s script capabilities was precipitately removed in 2010 when it was uncovered that certain functions were liable to resource exhaustion attacks (DDoS). Rather than address the underlying issue, Satoshi took an axe to everything he thought might be affected and the mangled, hacky byproduct is what we’re left with today. A lot of the conversation up to now has revolved around patching scripts with bandaids here and there to restore some functionality. This has inevitably dragged us into the deadends of horse trading and bikeshedding. </p><p>The restoration project flips this approach on its head and proposes we take the proper engineering steps to get there. If we agree on the destination, we should embrace this opportunity to change Bitcoin for the better. Political, social stigmas, and ossifiers be damned. This latter point cannot be emphasized enough. Intentional or not, Rusty’s presentation feels like a call for developers to liberate themselves from dogma and embrace science anew. <br><br>It turns out the best way to rope developers in is to nerd-snipe them with data, benchmarks, and measurements. I’ll leave it to more technical folks to lay out the details of his framework but it’s worth pointing out why it has proven so effective. By offering a model to account for the cost of each associated change, Rusty allows us to unite them all under the same umbrella. This is a significant departure from the existing framing which pitted every proposal against one another. Instead, we work together to fix what was previously abandoned and thought to be broken using thoughtful engineering.</p><h2>Trust the process</h2><p>To be clear, "The Great Script Restoration Project" hardly qualifies as a proposal yet. It is but a loose collection of ideas and some very early suggestions about how we might approach them. The reason it has gained so much traction in such a short time is that it is an opportunity to do things differently. To finish Satoshi’s work.</p><p>For the first time in a long, long time, some outlines of rough consensus are shaping up. Maybe not around a proposal, but at least around a process. That’s progress.</p><blockquote><p>“Let’s be engineers. Let’s be objective and let’s have rational arguments about this stuff. Yes, we will have to convince the rest of the world but that’s much much easier if we’re all pulling in the same direction”. - <a href="https://twitter.com/bergealex4/status/1786933357575606594">Christian Decker</a></p></blockquote> ]]>

For more information on services offered, custody products, and the relationship between Unchained and Bitcoin Magazine, please visit our <a href="https://unchained.bitcoinmagazine.com/">website</a>. </p></blockquote><p>For newcomers, especially those in and around retirement age, the idea of investing in or owning bitcoin can evoke reactions from skepticism to disbelief. If you look beyond the popular narratives, however, you might find there is more to the story than first impressions suggest. Here are six reasons to consider owning at least some bitcoin during retirement.</p><h3>1. Bitcoin helps broaden your asset allocation base</h3><p>Traditionally, investors use a strategy called <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/assetallocation.asp">asset allocation</a> to distribute and shield funds from investment risk over time. A sound asset allocation strategy is the antidote to putting all of your eggs in one basket. There are several types of asset “classes” or categories over which to distribute risk. Customarily, advisors seek to establish a dynamic mix between debt instruments (i.e., bonds), equities (i.e., stocks), real estate, cash, and commodities.</p><p>The more categories you employ to distribute your assets and the less correlated those categories are, the better your chances of balancing your risk, at least theoretically. Recently, due to unintended consequences caused by the aggressive expansion of societal debt and the money supply, assets that were previously less correlated now <a href="https://www.fidelityinternational.com/editorial/blog/chart-room-why-stockbond-correlations-are-turning-positive-03685b-en5/">tend to behave more in kind with one another</a>. When one sector gets hammered today, several sectors often suffer together.</p><p>Regardless of these present-day conditions, asset allocation remains a well-conceived strategy for moderating risk. While still in its relative infancy, bitcoin represents an entirely new asset class. Because of this, owning at least some bitcoin, especially due to its <a href="https://unchained.com/blog/bitcoin-not-blockchain/?utm_campaign=btcmag-launch">distinct properties when compared to other “cryptocurrencies</a>,” provides an opportunity to broaden your asset base and more effectively distribute your overall risk.</p><h3>2. Bitcoin offers a hedge against inflation and currency debasement</h3><blockquote><p>As a retiree, protecting yourself from inflation is crucial to preserving your long-term purchasing power. In the asset allocation discussion above, we referenced the recent and aggressive money supply expansion. Everyone who has lived long enough to approach retirement age knows that a dollar no longer buys what it used to. When the government issues large amounts of new money, it <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/debasement.asp">debases</a> the value of the dollars already in circulation. This generally pushes prices higher as newly created dollars begin to chase the existing limited supply of goods and services.</p></blockquote><p>Our own Parker Lewis <a href="https://unchained.com/blog/dollar-crisis-to-bitcoin/?utm_campaign=btcmag-launch">touched on this extensively</a> in his <em>Gradually, Then Suddenly</em> series:</p><blockquote><p>In summary, when trying to understand bitcoin as money, start with gold, the dollar, the Fed, quantitative easing and why bitcoin’s supply is fixed. Money is not simply a collective hallucination or a belief system; there is rhyme and reason. Bitcoin exists as a solution to the money problem that is global QE and if you believe the deterioration of local currencies in Turkey, Argentina or Venezuela could never happen to the U.S. dollar or to a developed economy, we are merely at a different point on the same curve.</p></blockquote><p>In contrast to fiat currencies, no one can increase the supply and arbitrarily reduce bitcoin’s value. There are no centralized authorities that govern its monetary policy. Despite <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4398232-bitcoin-is-not-hedge-against-inflation">arguments to the contrary</a>, bitcoin is similar to gold—but not exactly, because gold miners continue to inflate the supply of gold each year at a rate of 1-2%.</p><p>As bitcoin is slowly introduced to the circulating supply (i.e., mined), its inflation rate decreases and will eventually cease. This fact makes bitcoin uniquely scarce among global monetary assets. Ultimately, this scarcity, along with bitcoin’s other monetary properties, should safeguard its purchasing power. As such, owning bitcoin during retirement offers you a hedge against inflation.</p><figure> <a href="https://unchained.com/pricing/?utm_campaign=btcmag-launch" ><img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1NjkwMDEzMjkwMDc5Njg1/irabm_pro_bundle_newsletter_1200x300-1.jpg" height="300" width="1200"></a> <figcaption><em>Get $100 off Unchained IRA and receive 1-year free of Bitcoin Magazine Pro market research ($250 value).

Bitcoin offers an opportunity for asymmetric returns</h3><p>Bitcoin’s capacity to mitigate many of the challenges we discuss here rests on its ability to achieve asymmetric returns. Its supply is fixed (there will only ever be 21,000,000 bitcoin), and demand for the asset is growing steadily. As this limited supply collides with increased store-of-value adoption from individuals, institutions, and governments, bitcoin has the potential to dwarf the returns of nearly every competing asset class.</p><p>It’s worth noting that people generally improve their returns with bitcoin when they hold it for the long term. In the modern era, retirements lasting decades or more are increasingly common. Over such time periods, even a limited allocation to bitcoin offers ample opportunity to benefit from its upside potential. You just need time to hold through the short-term volatility, which contrary to popular belief, is <a href="https://unchained.com/blog/bitcoin-is-not-too-volatile/?utm_campaign=btcmag-launch">not evidence of it being a poor store of value</a>.</p><p>Sequestering a portion of funds solely for appreciation during retirement runs somewhat counter to conventional wisdom. Modern retirement planning generally optimizes for the liquidation of portfolio funds to provide income. However, setting aside a small amount of bitcoin—kept steadfastly gated from funds earmarked for income—opens the door to benefit from the monetization of bitcoin’s limited supply.</p><h3>4. Bitcoin offers protection from the risk of long-term bonds</h3><p>Conventionally, high-grade bonds—held directly or as fund shares—make up a <a href="https://finance.zacks.com/percentage-retirement-funds-should-bonds-be-4536.html">significant part of most retirement portfolios</a> due to their low risk levels and tendency toward capital preservation. However, things have changed.</p><p>Monetary expansion and increases in societal debt have forced bond yields—or the amount of interest paid (i.e., coupon)—to historically low levels. The yields on most bonds today fall well below the rate of inflation. This “negative real yield” means that owning a bond can cost you money. But the difficulty doesn’t end there.</p><p>Because retirees need funds from their portfolios to pay bills, they generally must sell assets at current market rates to derive income throughout retirement. In the case of bonds, at present, this can be very problematic. Consider the following equations.</p><ul><li>How much money does it take for a bond paying a 2% rate to yield $20? Answer: $1,000. ($1,000 x 2% = $20)</li><li>How much money does it take for a bond paying a 4% rate to yield $20? Answer: $500. ($500 x 4% = $20)</li></ul><p>These two equations reveal that to yield the same $20 return, the market value of the underlying bond changes based on the interest rate promised.</p><ul><li>When interest rates go up, the market value of bonds goes down.</li><li>When interest rates go down, the market value of bonds goes up.</li></ul><p>The market value of bonds has an inverse relationship to interest rates. Consider that interest rates today hover near historic lows. Over the next twenty to thirty years, what will happen to the market value of bonds held by retirees if interest rates increase substantially? The answer: the market value of their bonds will collapse.</p><figure> <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA2MTgxNDM4NjE2MjQ5NDQz/220418_bond_yields_6_reason_to_own_bitcoin_in_retirement_illustrations_1920x1080.png" height="675" width="1200"> </figure> <p>This changes the entire risk paradigm for bonds in retirement portfolios and potentially makes them far less safe than typically imagined. Bitcoin exists in a separate asset class from bonds; it is a bearer instrument that is not exposed to the same money market risks. As such, owning bitcoin may help you offset at least some of the potential risk incurred from owning bonds in retirement.</p><h3>5. Bitcoin offers a potential solution for long-term healthcare risk</h3><p>Another area of concern for retirees is the cost of healthcare. Here, I am not referring so much to ordinary medical bills but rather to the potential to incur long-term care expenses in later age. Insurance is available for long-term care, but it has some unique and increasingly difficult challenges to overcome.</p><p>Healthcare, in general, takes a double-hit when it comes to price inflation. Not only do healthcare costs rise due to monetary debasement, but healthcare faces additional headwinds from demand spurred by <a href="https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2020/65-older-population-grows.html">growth in the aging population</a>.</p><figure> <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA2MTgxNDQzOTg0OTU4ODc1/retirement-age-increase-chart-prev3-1024x652.png" height="764" width="1200"> <figcaption>Source: <a href="https://acl.gov/sites/default/files/Aging%20and%20Disability%20in%20America/2020ProfileOlderAmericans.Final_.pdf">Administration for Community Living – 2020 Profile of Older Americans</a></figcaption> </figure> <p>States regulate insurance for long-term care. To keep policyowners safe, insurers face scrutiny over where and how they invest policy premiums. To preserve capital required for future claims, insurers generally rely on low-risk, intermediate and long-term bonds. However, as our discussion above on bonds reveals, low yields and the potential for rising rates complicate this practice. One immediate fallout is that premiums for long-term care insurance policies have risen substantially.</p><p>We noted earlier bitcoin’s usefulness as an inflation hedge and its potential for long-term price appreciation. As it relates to long-term healthcare, it may make sense to set aside some bitcoin explicitly dedicated as a hedge for this rapidly increasing expense.</p><h3>6. Bitcoin offers you individual sovereignty</h3><p>The final reason we’ll consider for owning bitcoin in retirement is that it offers you increased individual sovereignty. Bitcoin provides you a level of ownership that is not achievable with other assets. It can easily be carried across borders with <a href="https://unchained.com/blog/what-is-a-bitcoin-seed-phrase/">a hardware wallet or seed phrase</a>, for example, or transferred peer-to-peer anywhere in the world at low cost.</p><p>If you hold bitcoin securely in a wallet you control, no central bank can steal the value of your bitcoin by printing it into oblivion. No CEO can dilute its value by issuing more of its “shares.” Nor can a bank arbitrarily block access to or confiscate your funds. Unlike centralized financial custodians, which can be ordered to freeze or withhold funds on the whims of government or other third-party authorities, bitcoin with keys properly held is resistant to these kinds of overreach.</p><p>Specifically for retirement purposes, you can also hold your own keys for bitcoin in an IRA. Products like the <a href="https://unchained.com/bitcoin-ira/?utm_campaign=btcmag-launch">Unchained IRA</a> are a robust tool for building and saving your wealth on a tax-advantaged basis. And holding your bitcoin keys in the form of a multisig collaborative custody vault allows you to eliminate all single points of failure while you do so.</p><figure> <a href="https://unchained.com/pricing/?utm_campaign=btcmag-launch" ><img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA2MTYyMDM2NjM4MzYwNjc1/btcmag100_100_off_promo_1200x300-1.jpg" height="300" width="1200"></a> <figcaption><em>Visit </em><em><a href="https://unchained.com/pricing/?utm_campaign=btcmag-launch">Unchained.com</a></em><em> for $100 off any Unchained financial services product with code “</em><em><a href="https://unchained.com/pricing/?utm_campaign=btcmag-launch">BTCMAG100</a></em><em>”</em></figcaption> </figure> <h3>Sound financial principles and owning bitcoin</h3><p>Benefitting from bitcoin does not require committing to wild speculation or thoughtless abandonment of sound financial principles. In contrast, the more you look at bitcoin through sound financial principles and apply them to your thinking, the greater the opportunities it provides. One steadfast financial principle that coincides with bitcoin ownership is prudence.</p><p>Macro-economic investment strategist Lyn Alden often speaks of establishing a “non-zero position” in bitcoin (i.e., owning at least some). The risk of losing a few portfolio percentage points in a worst-case scenario is, in my estimation, worth the potential upside. But to be clear, each person’s situation is unique. You must do your own research and make the best decisions you can about what works in your particular scenario.</p><blockquote><p>Originally published on <a href="https://unchained.com/blog/top-10-bitcoin-multisig-tips/?utm_campaign=btcmag-launchhttps://unchained.com/blog/six-reasons-bitcoin-retirement/?utm_campaign=btcmag-launch">Unchained.com</a>.<br><br><a href="https://unchained.com/utm_campaign=btcmag-launch">Unchained</a> is the official US Collaborative Custody partner of Bitcoin Magazine and an integral sponsor of related content published through Bitcoin Magazine.

<![CDATA[ <p>“The institutions are coming.”</p><p>Anyone who’s been in the Bitcoin space for any significant period of time has heard some prominent figure within the space utter this phrase.</p><p>In August 2020, when <a href="https://www.microstrategy.com/">MicroStrategy</a>, an American-based business software company, announced it would be <a href="https://fortune.com/2020/08/11/buying-bitcoin-microstrategy-cryptocurrenc/">purchasing bitcoin</a> to add it to its treasury, many thought that was the beginning of the institutional stampede.</p><p>But it wasn’t.</p><p>Sure, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/08/tesla-buys-1point5-billion-in-bitcoin.html">Tesla bought some bitcoin</a> the following year, only to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/07/20/tesla-converted-75percent-of-bitcoin-purchases-to-fiat-currency-in-q2-2022.html">dump 75% of it</a> soon after.</p><p>And so from 2020 through 2023, MicroStrategy was an anomaly. During these years, the company — led by Bitcoin permabull Michael Saylor — remained the only major corporation on Earth to convert a notable portion of its treasury into bitcoin.</p><p>Saylor’s vision to get MicroStrategy on a bitcoin standard hasn’t wavered, though.</p><p>Instead, he has doubled down and continued to guide MicroStrategy as it has put more bitcoin on its balance sheet. He’s also hosted a conference — MicroStrategy World: Bitcoin for Corporations — every year starting the year after his company made its first bitcoin purchase as a means to show other companies how to emulate MicroStrategy.</p><p>This year’s edition of the conference — held on May 1 and 2 in Las Vegas, NV — marked the beginning of a new era, according to Saylor, an era in which the time has come for institutions to follow MicroStrategy’s lead.</p><h2>The Age of Bitcoin For Institutions and Corporations Has Begun</h2><p>In Saylor’s keynote presentation on the second day of the conference entitled “There Is No Second Best”, he termed 2020-2023 the “crazy years” in the Bitcoin space.</p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/S3T4nhtHxOA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><p>He explained that these years were part of a period of “crypto chaos,” a period from which bitcoin emerged as the dominant and most trusted crypto asset.</p><p>What follows the crazy years, Saylor said, are the years in which institutions and corporations embrace Bitcoin, and he told Bitcoin Magazine in an <a href="https://x.com/BitcoinMagazine/status/1785414016397197667">X Spaces</a> on April 30, the day before the conference began, that he believes this new era began in January 2024, when <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/approved-spot-bitcoin-etfs-to-trade-on-us-markets-in-historic-milestone">11 spot Bitcoin ETFs launched</a> in the United States.</p><p>Let’s not just take Saylor’s word that a new day has dawned, though. Let’s consider what Hunter Horsley, CEO of <a href="https://bitwiseinvestments.com/">Bitwise</a>, one of the 11 financial institutions that launched a spot Bitcoin ETF in the US, had to say about institutional interest in bitcoin.</p><p>“The bitcoin ETFs have really brought bitcoin into the realm of possibility for a lot of traditional financial institutions,” Horsley said on a panel during the second day of the conference.</p><p>“A lot of traditional and reputable firms have started engaging with bitcoin in a way they never have before, but so few of them are saying anything about it. If you just scroll through your LinkedIn or you read press releases, you would think that nothing has changed versus last year, but, for now, most — or many — are preferring not to have it be public,” he added.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">JUST IN: $3.5 billion Bitwise CEO says &quot;A lot of traditional and reputable firms have started engaging with <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bitcoin?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Bitcoin</a> in a way they never have before, but so few are saying anything about it.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Banks are reaching out to us&quot; 👀 <a href="https://t.co/h0jjhrzZQ6">pic.twitter.com/h0jjhrzZQ6</a></p>&mdash; Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) <a href="https://twitter.com/BitcoinMagazine/status/1786133907051536807?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 2, 2024</a></blockquote> <script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> <p>Alexander Leishman, CEO and CTO, of Bitcoin exchange <a href="https://river.com/">River</a>, also pointed out in his presentation that while buying bitcoin has traditionally been a retail investor-driven phenomenon, more and more businesses are beginning to dip their toes into the bitcoin waters, as well.</p><p>In one of his slides, Leishman pointed out that the percentages of businesses and funds/ETFs that hold bitcoin may not seem like a lot, but they’re bigger than they’ve been in previous years.</p><figure> <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA2MTc4NzQ0MDYxMTQyMTE1/screenshot-2024-05-03-at-64243am.png" height="590" width="1200"> <figcaption>Alexander Leishman, CEO and CTO of River, explained how the percentage of businesses and funds/ETFs owning bitcoin is still small but has been increasing.</figcaption> </figure> <p>“We have businesses, funds and ETFs and governments, these large institutions, these blue and black bars. These bars have gone from virtually nothing to where they are today, but they’re continuing to grow,” Leishman said.</p><p>“Retail is not really driving the recent rally in the bitcoin price. Consumer interest in bitcoin is nowhere near its all-time highs. So, what is driving this price increase? We think that one big factor is institutions,” he added.</p><p>According to David Marcus, CEO of <a href="https://www.lightspark.com/">Lightspark</a>, in the near future, institutions won’t just be looking to hold bitcoin on their balance sheet or offer it to their customers, but they’ll start using it for payments.</p><h2>Lightspark Is Using Lightning To Link Businesses Globally</h2><p>To conclude the first day of the conference, Saylor sat down for a fireside chat with Marcus, <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/former-paypal-meta-executive-on-bitcoin-lightning-payments">former executive at PayPal and former lead for Facebook’s abandoned cryptocurrency project Libra</a>, to discuss how the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/lightning-network">Lightning Network</a> will connect businesses across the world.</p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DCeJ5A1CgmE" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><p>Lightspark <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/coinbase-integrates-bitcoin-lightning-for-100-million-users">made headlines</a> the day before the conference began, as it announced Coinbase would be using Lightspark to integrate Lightning for its US users.</p><p>According to Marcus, Coinbase was just the first of many companies that would soon be harnessing the power of Lightning.</p><p>“In a world where you’ll have hundreds of millions if not billions of people that have an address for money that can be settled in real time in the currency that they’re choosing, you can imagine all kinds of new applications [for businesses],” said Marcus about companies using Lightning to not only send sats, but digitized versions of fiat currencies, as well. </p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">&quot;The time is now to enable fast cheap, realtime movement of Bitcoin and other assets [on Lightning].&quot;<br>-David Marcus, CEO, LightSpark <a href="https://twitter.com/lightspark?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@lightspark</a><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/BitcoinforCorporations?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#BitcoinforCorporations</a></p>&mdash; MicroStrategy (@MicroStrategy) <a href="https://twitter.com/MicroStrategy/status/1785813796490985710?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 1, 2024</a></blockquote> <script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> <p>“Streaming money to endpoints is one of them. New forms of payments for merchants that would reach new audiences or new client bases that they couldn’t reach [previously]. The ability to create brand new business models to enable people to actually contribute to anything that you’re building from anywhere around the world,” he added. </p><p>“It will have an impact on the world that is going to be as important as the internet itself was in its own time for communications.”</p><p>Marcus also touched on how companies are more multinational in nature than individual Bitcoin users and will greatly benefit from moving value around the world in real time via Lightning.</p><p>It was difficult not to be bullish on Bitcoin and Lightning after listening to Marcus and Saylor converse.</p><p>It was also difficult not to be bullish on Bitcoin not just as a store of value and a medium of exchange, but as a platform for trust after Cezary Raczko, Executive Vice President of Engineering at MicroStrategy, <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/microstrategy-announces-decentralized-id-platform-on-bitcoin-called-microstrategy-orange">revealed its plans for MicroStrategy Orange</a>, a decentralized identity (DID) platform built on the Bitcoin <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/what-is-blockchain">blockchain</a>.</p><h2>MicroStrategy Orange</h2><p>MicroStrategy Orange is an enterprise platform that empowers organizations to employ DID applications, built directly on the base layer of Bitcoin.</p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nXQWj6P0P1k" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><p>It’s the first technological innovation involving Bitcoin that MicroStrategy has been a part of.</p><p>“The platform consists of three fundamental pieces,” said Raczko. “At the heart of it, is a service cloud hosted that allows you to issue those identifiers to your users in your organization. It also allows you to deploy applications that run on MicroStrategy Orange. The Orange SDK allows you to integrate the applications into your own services. And the Orange apps are going to be prepackaged solutions that address specific digital identity challenges.”</p><p>This news came as a pleasant surprise to many at the conference, as it illustrated that MicroStrategy wants to continue to lead the way with Bitcoin adoption — outside of its store of value use case — as we enter this new era of businesses and institutions adopting Bitcoin.</p><h2>Normalizing Bitcoin For Corporations</h2><p>Conversations both on and off the conference stage revolved around Bitcoin maturing from a taboo entity, to something that’s becoming more normal, making it more difficult to ignore for companies and institutions.</p><p>In conversations I had with Bitcoin industry leaders like Becca Rubenfeld, COO of <a href="https://anchorwatch.com/">AnchorWatch</a>; Sam Abbassi, founder and CEO of <a href="https://www.hoseki.app/">Hoseki</a>; and Nathan McCauley, co-founder and CEO of <a href="https://www.anchorage.com/">Anchorage Digital</a>, I learned that companies and institutions that once wrote Bitcoin off as being little more than a scam or fad, are now beginning to inquire about how they can adopt it.</p><p>“It’s exciting to be at a stage of adoption where access to bitcoin is being expanded to businesses and their clients,” Rubenfeld told Bitcoin Magazine. “This event is particularly oriented to that, which allows conversation to be focused on the benefits and challenges unique to that new set of Bitcoin owners.”</p><p>While it’s taken some time for corporations to come around to Bitcoin, it’s clear that we’re at the onset of an era in which they’re beginning to see the value in it.</p><p>Even if companies and institutions aren’t necessarily ready to adopt a bitcoin standard the way that MicroStrategy has, it does seem that more are willing to have some exposure to bitcoin the asset or begin using Lightning for payments or apps that utilize the Bitcoin blockchain.</p><p>For this, we have Michael Saylor and the team at MicroStrategy to thank.</p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ <p>In a Keynote address at <a href="https://www.microstrategy.com/world-2024/bitcoin-for-corporations">MicroStrategy World: Bitcoin for Corporations</a>, MicroStrategy Executive Chairman Michael Saylor delivered a masterclass on corporate finance and the power of bitcoin to supercharge corporate balance sheets. Saylor made a point to emphasize Bitcoin as the <em>single </em>solution for capital appreciation in an inflationary environment.</p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/S3T4nhtHxOA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><p>In his speech, Saylor likened the cost of capital to being the benchmark which a company must surpass to <em>increase</em> its purchasing power, arguing that “Bitcoin is the <em>only</em> asset that exceeds the cost of capital. Another way to say that,<em> </em>is<em> everything else is dilutive</em>.”<br><br>Further describing the <em>true </em>cost of capital, he noted that the “S&P is the modern surrogate for the cost of capital… If you had to pick one metric and say, what's the metric that gives you a sense of how rapidly the world currency supply is expanding in dollars? Probably the S&P 500… this is another way to see inflation.”<br><br>Saylor went on to emphasize his belief that all assets, except bitcoin, are not accretive to corporate balance sheets despite their general acceptance. In particular, he highlighted the relative underperformance of the silver, gold and US government bonds:<br></p><figure> <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA2MTYwMTk2NzgxODc2MzIz/screenshot-2024-05-02-at-34739pm.png" height="674" width="1200"> </figure> <p>“[If companies] invested in T-bills, they're going to get 3% after tax against a 12% cost of capital per year. And so you hold $100 billion of capital, you destroy $9 billion of shareholder value a year… The story here is that the bonds don't hold value, right? They're awful capital assets. Silver doesn't work. Gold doesn't keep up with the cost of capital.”</p><h4>There Is No Second-Best Crypto Asset</h4><p>The MicroStrategy Executive Chairman noted key differences between Bitcoin and alternative cryptocurrencies like Ethereum, expressing the importance and necessity of proof-of-work-based consensus in creating a digital commodity.<br><br>“You could see the writing on the wall when the spot ETF of Bitcoin was approved in January. By the end of May, you'll know that Ethereum is not going to be approved.

<![CDATA[ <p>The last six months or so have seen several proposals for improvements to Bitcoin Script: <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/op-cat-the-purr-fect-solution-for-covenants-">CAT</a>, 64-bit arithmetic, as well as some older ideas (CTV) and far-future ideas (Chialisp and <a href="https://blog.blockstream.com/simplicity-language/">Simplicity</a>). This activity has largely overshadowed some revolutionary changes in our understanding of the existing Bitcoin Script, changes which form the basis of BitVM but which may also form the basis of other, equally-exciting improvements.</p><p>This article tries to summarize and organize research into Script by other people. I make no claim to originality or authorship of anything described here.</p><h2>Bitcoin Script</h2><p>As many readers are aware, Bitcoin Script is a simple programming language embedded in the Bitcoin blockchain, which is used to control under what conditions coins may move. By far the most common use of Script is to simply check a signature with a single signature verification key. Though Bitcoin addresses have changed throughout the years, every form of address has supported this use of script in a first-class way: signing keys can be encoded directly into Bitcoin addresses, and wallets know how to expand these keys into full programs that check signatures on those keys.</p><p>Script can do many more things: it can check hash preimages, check relative and absolute timelocks, and it can do some simple reasoning to combine these checks in various ways. This is the premise behind Miniscript: we can generalize the notion of expanding a key into a Script to the notion of expanding an arbitrarily-large set of signing conditions into a Script.</p><p>Script can technically do even more than this: it can add and subtract 32-bit numbers, it can hash data and check the hash values for equality, and it can rearrange and manipulate a "stack" of values in various interesting ways. However, Script has many limitations: it lacks opcodes to do simple arithmetic such as multiplication, it is (nearly) incapable of reasoning about objects larger than 32 bits, and it has (nearly) no ability to introspect transaction data. The latter limitation is why covenant support appears to require a softfork, and the former limitations are why Script, until recently, was never used to compute any "interesting" functions.</p><p>For example, to multiply two 16-bit numbers in Script, using only the addition and subtraction opcodes that Script provides, you need to break them into bits (by requiring the bits be provided as witness data, then doubling and adding them to reconstruct the original number) and then implementing multiplication in terms of additions of these bits. The resulting code would involve several dozen opcodes for a single multiplication.</p><p>Prior to Taproot, Script had an artificial limit of 201 opcodes per program, and with individual multiplications taking more than a quarter of this budget, it was impossible to do much of anything. After Taproot, the 201-opcode limit was removed, but every opcode still takes up a witness byte, meaning that multi-kilobyte programs would be prohibitively expensive for ordinary wallets to put on the blockchain.</p><p>And without transaction introspection, it isn't even clear what large computations would be good for. </p><p>After all, if you can do arbitrary computations on arbitrary values, but those values aren't tied to transaction data on the blockchain, how can those computations add useful semantics to Bitcoin?</p><h2>Lamport Signatures</h2><p>Lamport signatures were invented in 1979 by Leslie Lamport -- though they are insecure without modern cryptographic hash functions, which did not exist until the 1990s -- and are one of the few cryptographic objects from that era which endure to this day. Their lasting popularity comes from their simplicity and the fact that their security against quantum computers depends only on sufficiently-random-looking hash functions, unlike more modern and efficient proposals for quantum-secure signature schemes.</p><p>However, Lamport signatures come with two large drawbacks: (1) they are horribly inefficient, taking multiple kilobytes of data for both keys and signatures, and (2) they are single-use. This means that if a user signs more than one message, it becomes possible for a 3rd party to forge more messages, making all signatures effectively worthless. This can be mitigated, for example by having your “public key” be a Merkle tree of millions of single-use keys, but this stretches the bounds of practicality..</p><p>These limitations have made Lamport signatures popular as a "backup signature scheme" for Bitcoin in case of a quantum computing breakthrough, but have prevented their use as primary signatures in any widely deployed system.</p><p>The way they work is simple: assume that the message to be signed is 256 bits wide. This can be assured by first running an arbitrary-length message through the SHA256 hash function. The user's public key consists of 256 pairs of hashes – 512 in total. To sign a message, they reveal a preimage for one hash in each pair, choosing the preimage to reveal based on a bit of the message.</p><p>A signature verifier re-hashes the message and preimages to ensure they are all consistent.</p><p>In 2021, <a href="https://rubin.io/blog/2021/07/02/signing-5-bytes/">Jeremy Rubin posted a blog post</a> claiming that Bitcoin Script can directly verify Lamport signatures on 33-bit values. His mechanism was very clever. Bitcoin Script does not have an opcode to read individual bits from a number, nor can it do the bitwise operations needed to construct a number from bits. But Script does have an opcode to add two numbers, and by adding different numbers where each has only a single bit set, it is possible to bitwise-construct or bitwise-deconstruct a number.</p><p>Using this insight, Rubin checks a Lamport signature, encoded as a series of hash preimages, as follows:</p><ol><li>For each preimage, compute its hash and compare it against a pair of target values (comprising the public key) embedded in the Script.</li><li>If the hash matches the first member of the pair, this is a 0-bit; the script does nothing in this case.</li><li>If it matches the second member, this is a 1-bit. In this case, add a particular power of 2 to an accumulator.</li><li>(If it matches neither member, the signature is invalid and the script should abort.)</li></ol><p>The final value of the accumulator will then equal the signed number, constructed by adding powers of two corresponding to each 1 bit in its binary expansion.</p><p>Already this is interesting: it means that for certain kinds of "oracle signature" applications, you can directly check signatures in Bitcoin Script, assuming you have an oracle that is willing to produce one-time Lamport signatures on specific events and that you know a Lamport public key in advance for each event. For example, a specific sports match outcome can be encoded as a single bit. The particular score can be encoded using a few bits. A particular timestamp can (probably) be encoded in 33 bits. And so on. And of course, by checking multiple Lamport signatures, you can effectively get signatures on as many bits as you want.</p><p>Without the ability to sign large messages, you can't get a signature on transaction data and therefore can’t get covenants. (<a href="https://groups.google.com/g/bitcoindev/c/mR53go5gHIk">Or can we?</a>)</p><h2>BitVM and Equivocation</h2><p>This blog post by Jeremy Rubin was largely considered to be a curiosity at the time and was lost among larger discussions around his OP_CTV proposal and covenants. In December of 2023, it was indirectly cited in the <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/1525">OP_CAT BIP by Ethan Heilman and Armin Sabouri</a>, which gave it a fresh audience among people who were thinking differently about Bitcoin Script.</p><p>People were thinking differently because in October 2023, just two months prior, Robin Linus had <a href="https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2023-October/021984.html">announced on the mailing list his project BitVM</a>—an ambitious project to do arbitrary computations in Bitcoin Script by splitting programs across multiple transactions. The individual transactions each do a single simple operation, with outputs from one operation hooked to inputs of another via a hash-preimage-revealing construction that looks suspiciously similar to a Lamport signature.</p><p>The trick here is that if a user Lamport-signs multiple messages with the same key, the result will be two hashes in the same hash-pair whose preimages are both known. This is easy to check for in Script, which can be used to construct a "slashing transaction" that will take coins from a user if they do this. Such a slashing transaction would then become valid exactly in the case that a user publicly signed two messages with the same key. Slashing transactions are used within multi-transaction protocols to punish users who misbehave, typically by forfeiting a bond that they must post ahead of time.</p><p>So these Lamport signatures, rather than merely losing security when they are used more than once, can be configured to actively punish a user who signs multiple times. This has obvious applications for an oracle signature where a signer is supposed to attest to exactly one outcome of a real-life event; we want to disincentivize such a signer from claiming that e.g. both teams won a particular sports match. But this is an even more powerful idea than it seems.</p><p>In the cryptographic literature, when a party reveals two values for something that is supposed to be unique, this is called equivocation. We can <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2810103.2813686">think of a slashing transaction as an anti-equivocation measure</a>, because it punishes any signer who produces signatures on the same key with the same message.</p><p>Then our Lamport signature with anti-equivocation construction has the effect of mapping public keys to specific and immutable values. In other words, we have a global key-value store accessible from Script, with the curious property that each entry in the global store can be set by a specific person (the person who knows the preimages for that key), but can only be set once for all time. This key-value store is also accessible from any Bitcoin transaction (or a transaction on any blockchain, really) regardless of its connection to other transactions.</p><p>This key-value store has on the order of 2^256 entries, most of which are not accessible since nobody knows the preimages to their keys, so while it is a "global key-value store" shared by every possible program using this Lamport signature construction, it cannot fill up and there is no risk that data from one program might accidentally clobber data from another, or that a value which should be set by one user might be set by another. Nor is the key-value store actually stored anywhere in its entirety.</p><p>BitVM and its variants use this fact to tie the output of one operation to the input of the next: a given program can be split into a long series of basic operations, for example opcodes in the RISC-V instruction set, and each of these basic operations can be implemented by a self-contained Script program which looks up the operation's inputs and outputs in the key-value store, checks that they are related correctly, and somehow punishes the user if not.</p><p>The complete BitVM system is much more complicated than this: for each program, it carves out an addressable memory space from the key-value store; each operation needs to look up its inputs and outputs from this memory space; each operation needs to track a program counter and other state beyond its inputs and outputs; and the whole thing is tied together with interactive protocols and trees of unconfirmed transactions to ensure than slashing penalties are correctly enforced and that even a single incorrect step in a multi-billion-step program can be zeroed-in-on and punished. But this article is not about BitVM and we will not explore this.</p><h2>Interlude: Small Script and Big Script</h2><p>We take a moment to remind the reader that Script can only do non-trivial computations on values that are 32 bits wide or smaller. Such values are "scriptnums" and Script has many opcodes to manipulate them by interpreting them as signed integers or boolean values, sometimes as both.</p><p>Using BitVM or a similar mechanism to split Script programs across multiple transactions, you can do arbitrary computations in Small Script, from ZKP verification to proof-of-work checking to number factoring.</p><p>Values that are larger than 32 bits can only be manipulated by a small set of narrow-purpose opcodes: they can be hashed, interpreted as public keys or signatures to check a transaction signature, their size in bytes can be computed, and they can be moved around the stack as opaque blobs. The only "real" general-purpose computation that can be done on them is a check for equality, which by itself provides very little value.</p><p>We describe the world of 32-bit values as "Small Script", which is computationally expressive but cannot access transaction data in any way. The world of larger values we call "Big Script", and can access transaction data through the CHECKSIG opcode. It is also possible to check hash preimages in Big Script, and this is essential to implementing Lamport signatures, but that's pretty much the only thing you can do in Big Script.</p><p>It is impossible to usefully bridge the two worlds: you can hash a Small value to get a Big value, but you cannot then learn anything about the Big value that you didn't already know. And you can use the SIZE opcode to learn the size of a Big value, but if this value represents a hash, public key or signature, then its size is fixed so you learn nothing new. (Although prior to Taproot, signatures had a variable size, and it is <a href="https://groups.google.com/g/bitcoindev/c/mR53go5gHIk">possible that you can extract transaction information</a> from a suitably constrained CHECKSIG-passing transaction.)</p><p>All this to remind the reader that, while this new Script functionality is exciting, it provides a lot of computation expressivity without the ability to inspect transaction data, and therefore cannot be used for vaults or other covenant applications. </p><p>The <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/1525">CAT opcode</a> provides a mechanism to bridge the two Scripts, which is why CAT is sufficient to provide covenants. This is also why there are so many ways in which Script "almost" supports covenants, or in which non-covenant-related proposals like CAT turn out to enable covenants: pretty much any opcode that takes Small values and outputs Big ones, or vice-versa, can be used to feed Big Script transaction data into a Small Script general program. Even a sufficiently bad break of the SHA1 opcode could probably be used as a bridge, because then you could do "computations" on Big values by interpreting them as SHA1 hashes and finding Small preimages for them.</p><h2>Interlude: Wormholes</h2><p>Actually, there is a way that you can get covenants in Small Script, assuming you have enough computational power. By going "outside" of Script, users can validate the Bitcoin blockchain itself, as well as the transaction that contains the Script (it needs to avoid directly encoding its own data to avoid being infinitely-sized, but this can be done by indirect means; see the next section for more details), and then impose additional constraints on the transaction by imposing those constraints on this internally-validated "view" of itself.</p><p>This idea could allow the creation of some limited covenant functionality, but it is important to remember that correct access to the key-value store, which is necessary in order to split large computations, is not directly enforced. Instead, some additional mechanism needs to be imposed to enforce slashing penalties on incorrect access. This greatly complicates the implementation of vault-like covenants whose functionality depends on certain spending patterns actually being impossible, not just disincentivized.</p><h2>Tic-Tac-Toe</h2><p>Thus far we have talked about the anti-equivocation feature of Lamport signatures, and how this can be used to effect a "global key-value store" in Bitcoin Script, which in turn can be used to pass data between Script programs and to split large computations into many independent parts. But there is another interesting and perhaps surprising aspect of Lamport signatures, which is that they allow committing to a unique value in a script without that value affecting the TXID of its transaction.</p><p>This has two consequences: one is that we can commit data in a transaction without affecting its TXID, meaning that we can potentially change parameters within a Script program without invalidating chains of unconfirmed transactions. The other is that we can commit data without affecting the signature hash, meaning that users can "pre-sign" a transaction without first knowing all of its data.</p><p>(By the way, these properties apply to any signature scheme, provided there is a check to punish the signing of multiple values. What is interesting about Lamport signatures is that we can use them in Bitcoin today.)</p><p>The ability to put data into a Script program without affecting the TXID of the contained transaction opens the door to constructions in which a program is able to refer to its own code (for example, by injecting the TXID itself into the program, which is a hash of all transaction data including the program). This is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quine_(computing)">Quining</a>, and can be used to enable delegation and to create recursive covenants. This ability is the motivation behind the disconnect combinator in Simplicity. However, since we can only validate Lamport signatures in Small Script, which excludes objects as large as txids, it appears that there is currently nothing we can do in that direction. However, nothing is stopping us from emulating non-recursive covenants with similar tricks.</p><p>Let's describe <a href="https://github.com/supertestnet/bitvm-workshop">an example due to supertestnet on Github</a>.</p><p>Consider the game tic-tac-toe, played between two people who take turns marking a three-by-three grid. The rules are simple: no player may mark an already-marked square, and if either player marks three squares in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) then they win. Imagine that these players want to play this game on-chain, representing each turn by a transaction.</p><p>Of course, in parallel to these transactions, they would have a single “happy path” transaction where both parties would just sign coins over to the winner so that if they agreed on the events of the game, they wouldn’t actually need to publish the individual turns! But it’s important to also construct the full game transcript so that in the case of disputes, the blockchain can mediate.</p><p>One approach they might take is to model the game as a series of pre-signed transactions, which each require a signature from both players. The first player has nine possible moves. So the second player would sign all nine, and the first player would sign whichever one they wanted to take. Then for each of the nine possible moves, the second player has eight moves; so the first player signs all eight, and the second player picks one to sign, and so on.</p><p>It turns out that this doesn’t quite work – because either player might refuse to sign a particular move, there is no way to assign blame in the case that the game stalls out, and therefore no incentive for the losing player to complete the game. To prevent this situation, each player must sign all of his counterparty’s moves before the game starts. Then a player can only refuse to sign his own moves, and this can be easily disincentivized by adding timelocked forfeit conditions to the transactions.</p><p>As an alternative to having each player sign the other players’ moves, a trusted third party could be enlisted to pre-sign each move. But the result is the same: every possible series of transactions must be signed. For the tic-tac-toe game, there are 255168 paths for a total of 549945 pre-signed transactions. This is pushing the bounds of practicality, and it’s clear that such a strategy will not generalize to nontrivial games. For chess, for example, these values are bounded below by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shannon_number">Shannon number</a>, which is 10^120.</p><p>The reason that we have such a large blow-up is that we are distinguishing between moves by distinct transactions which each must be set up before the game has started.</p><p>However, using Lamport signatures, we can do much better:</p><ul><li>Each game of tic-tac-toe has (at most) nine moves,</li><li>Each of which is a transition between two board states, that are small enough to be Lamport-signed,</li><li>And each transition must obey rules which are simple enough to reasonably encode within Script.</li></ul><p>We can therefore approach the game differently: each player generates a Lamport public key with which to sign the game state after each of their moves (so the first player generates 5 keys, the second player 4). They then generate a series of 9 transactions whose output taptrees have three branches:</p><p>1. A “ordinary move” branch, consisting of</p><ul><li>An ordinary signature from both players;</li><li>A Lamport signature on the previous game state from the appropriate player,</li></ul><ul><li>A Lamport signature on the next game state from the other player,</li><li>And a check, implemented in Script, that the two-game states are correctly related (they differ by exactly one legal move by the correct player).</li></ul><p>2. A “win condition”, consisting of</p><ul><li>An ordinary signature from both players;</li><li>A Lamport signature on the previous ga)me state from the appropriate player,</li><li>A check, implemented in Script, that this player has won the game.</li></ul><p>3. A “timeout” condition, consisting of</p><ul><li>An ordinary signature from both players;</li><li>A relative timelock that has expired.</li></ul><p>The final transaction, in place of an “ordinary move” branch, has a “draw” branch, since if all moves have completed without a win, there is no winner and presumably any coins at stake should go back to their original owners.</p><p>As before, each player pre-signs all transactions, of which there are 27, including “win condition” transactions (which send all the coins to the winning player), “timeout condition” transactions (which send all the coins to the player who didn’t time out) and “draw condition”.</p><p>And by the way, while the rules of Chess are a fair bit more complicated, and the board state may require multiple 32-bit values to represent, and there may be more than 9 moves, it is still feasible to carry out exactly the same construction.</p><h2>Transaction Trees</h2><p>In the previous example, we took great advantage of the fact that the rules of tic-tac-toe can be embedded in Script itself, meaning that a user cannot usefully sign an invalid game state. (If they sign an invalid move, the transaction representing the move will be invalid, and the transactions representing all future moves will also be invalid because they depend on it. So all the attacker will have accomplished is leaking part of his Lamport signing key, allowing the other player to potentially forge moves on his behalf.</p><p>We also took advantage of the fact that our complete protocol was not very long: at most 9 moves. This means that if one player refuses to complete the game, or completes the game but will not acknowledge the result, it is reasonable to publish the entire game transcript on-chain as a recourse. For many games this is sufficient.</p><p>It is out of scope of this blog post, but there are many tricks we can play with this model: checking single-party computations as a “game” between a prover and verifier, outsourcing one or both roles, combining multiple steps into single transactions with large taptrees, replacing the linear transcript with a binary search for invalid steps, and so on. These tricks form the basis for BitVM, BitVM 2, BitVMX, and so forth.</p><p>Using such tricks, we can reduce the cost of existing protocols that depend on trees of unsigned transactions. A classic 2017 Bitcoin paper by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.05390v1">Bentov and Miller</a> argues that stateful protocols in the UTXO model always suffer an exponential blowup relative to analogous protocols in the account model, e.g. on Ethereum. Using Lamport signatures as a global key-value store, we can partially refute this paper. But we are out of space and will need to explore this in our next post!</p><h2>Acknowledgments</h2><p>I would like to thank Robin Linus and Ethan Heilman for reviewing an early draft of this post.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Andrew Poelstra.

<![CDATA[ <p><strong>UPDATE: </strong>Additional blockchain analysis <a href="https://x.com/mononautical/status/1786061757280063836?s=46&t=qcJDE0RaWiQjEKjMZF2JjA">indicates</a> this purchase was the result of a for-profit "sat hunting operation" that was <a href="https://mempool.space/address/bc1pxpn5jmgz0ly03vnvgsamgv7tt4cqn9agj2ehm52asd09fphkwmfq3hkuax">programmatically</a> buying and withdrawing Bitcoin from Binance. The article has been revised accordingly.</p><p>One of just four rare "Epic Sats," as defined the Ordinals protocol, was discovered and withdrawn from the Bitcoin and crypto exchange Binance today.</p><p>These special satoshis, which do not exist natively on Bitcoin, but can be identified by a companion piece of software, are considered some of the most scarce and significant in Bitcoin's history. While Bitcoin has a hard limit of 2.1 quadrillion satoshis, or 21 million BTC, the protocol does not track them individually. </p><p>This sequencing is only identified in the Ordinals protocol, a top-level meta-protocol built on Bitcoin.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">BREAKING: The first satoshi of <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bitcoin?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Bitcoin</a>’s second halving block was just found by a Binance user.<br><br>A $10 transaction worth 33 <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24BTC&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">$BTC</a>. Jackpot 🙌 <a href="https://t.co/rLE16ogNsc">pic.twitter.com/rLE16ogNsc</a></p>&mdash; Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) <a href="https://twitter.com/BitcoinMagazine/status/1786017704039633236?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 2, 2024</a></blockquote> <script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> <p>The term "Epic Sat" refers to the first satoshi of each Bitcoin halving era, which occurs about every four years. Recently, <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/one-of-only-four-bitcoin-epic-sats-just-auctioned-off-for-over-2-1-million">the first Epic Sat from the 2024 </a>halving sold for over $2 million at auction, sparking intrigue around these rare units.</p><p>In this case, the Binance user withdrew a transaction containing the Epic Sat from the 420,000th Bitcoin block in 2016. Binance failed to identify and retain the UTXO that contained the valuable satoshi for itself, representing a potential multi-million dollar oversight.</p><p>While initially believed to be a single exchange user, analysis <a href="https://mempool.space/address/bc1pxpn5jmgz0ly03vnvgsamgv7tt4cqn9agj2ehm52asd09fphkwmfq3hkuax">by Mononaut on X</a> reveals the acquirer was likely a sophisticated operation that was exploring Binance's inventory for UTXOs that may link to rare sats on Ordinals.</p><p>Blockchain analysis shows this UTXO, categorized by Ordinals as containing sat number "<a href="https://www.ord.io/sat/1575000000000000">1575000000000000</a>," moved to the user's wallet after they bought and transferred bitcoin. </p><p>Its rarity compares to winning the lottery, as only four such "Epic Sats" exist until now. (In total, 34 will be released over subsequent halvings). </p><p>The wallet address that now contains the UTXO that points to the coveted satoshi is bc1ptjcsnnycr52ccwg4mvvsczkwzvc0qydlxw6q7pcelxkx8equk3asduuz86. </p><p>Market observers will now doubtless wait to see whether the holder keeps the Epic Sat for themselves or sells it off, potentially for millions.</p><p>Sleuths can verify the transaction by referencing Ordinals indexing tools like <a href="https://www.ord.io/">Ord.io</a> and <a href="https://ordinals.com/">Ordinals.com</a>. These identify the satoshi's number and position in the chain, allowing its location to be traced via an explorer-like Mempool.space.</p><p>While controversial, these Epic Sats create profound digital scarcity akin to rare collectables. The Binance user's good fortune may ignite further interest and intensify the search for the remaining two Epic Sats from 2012 and 2020.</p> ]]>

Recent 13F filings <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/second-largest-european-bank-is-buying-bitcoin-etf-13f-sec-fillings">have shown</a> major institutional buyers making small allocations to these newly regulated Bitcoin products.</p><p>Now, despite a recent cooldown and outflows from Bitcoin ETFs amidst market volatility, BlackRock remains bullish on institutional demand long-term. The firm's head of digital assets, Robert Mitchnick, said in an interview he expects sovereign wealth funds, pensions, and endowments to start trading spot Bitcoin ETFs in the coming months.</p><p>Mitchnick stated that BlackRock has been in educational conversations with these institutions about Bitcoin for years. The asset manager is unfazed even after iShares IBIT saw its first-ever outflows this week following 71 straight days of inflows.</p><p>Mitchnick believes the current lull will be followed by a new wave of buying from deep-pocketed institutional players. As more giants like BlackRock build multi-billion dollar Bitcoin reserves, it validates Bitcoin as an investable asset class.</p><p>The ETF conversations also come as BlackRock CEO Larry Fink has softened his once critical stance on Bitcoin.</p><p>With iShares IBIT quickly accumulating over $17 billion in Bitcoin, BlackRock has proven the massive latent demand for regulated Bitcoin investment vehicles.</p><p>Despite short-term ETF outflows amid volatility, its long-term outlook remains highly optimistic.</p><figure> <a href="https://bm.b.tc/unchained-bmag-dot-com" ><img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA0MzE5MTg5MTE1NDc5NDkz/bm-x-unchained-article-cta---learn-more.png" height="507" width="1200"></a> <figcaption><em>Click the image to learn more.</em></figcaption> </figure> <p>As Mitchnick stated, "Many of these interested firms – whether we're talking about pensions, endowments, sovereign wealth funds, insurers, other asset managers, family offices – are having ongoing diligence and research conversations, and we're playing a role from an education perspective."</p><p>All in all, such educated, pragmatic institutional interest bodes well for the continued growth of the Bitcoin ETF market.</p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ <p>Korok Ray, Bitcoin researcher and Associate Professor at the Mays Business School at Texas A&M University, announced plans to launch The Bitcoin Research Institute to drive academic research at the intersection of Bitcoin and artificial intelligence.<br><br>At the <a href="https://www.microstrategy.com/world-2024/bitcoin-for-corporations">MicroStrategy World: Bitcoin for Corporations 2024</a> event, Ray made note of Bitcoin’s potential to enable secure multi-party computation (MPC), offering the example of poker players agreeing on the state of a particular game as a basic form of computation.</p><p>He expanded this example to include deep neural networks and agent-based reinforcement learning, whereby artificially intelligent agents could collectively perform computations in the context of the Bitcoin blockchain. Ray’s vision made note of new developments in the Bitcoin ecosystem such as BITVM, which allows off-chain Turing complete computation, as in the case of MPC, to be verified on Bitcoin.</p><blockquote><p>For more on BitVM read: <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/the-big-deal-with-bitvm-arbitrary-computation-now-possible-on-bitcoin-without-a-fork">"The Big Deal With BitVM: Arbitrary Computation Now Possible on Bitcoin WIthout a Fork"</a> by Shinobi, Bitcoin Magazine Technical Editor</p></blockquote><p>Ray went on to propose his thesis, describing Bitcoin and AI combined as "The Undiscovered Country":</p><figure> <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA2MTM4MzcyMTczODY2NDk1/screenshot-2024-05-01-at-53419pm.png" height="683" width="1200"> <figcaption>Korok Ray at MicroStrategy World: Bitcoin for Corporations 2024</figcaption> </figure> <p>"The ultimate use case of Bitcoin in say one-hundred, two-hundred or five-hundred years, will not be humans, but machines...  as we are at [this] wave of massive technological progress, I believe the biggest opportunity will be deep integration between machines and the entire Bitcoin network at different levels."</p><p>“The Bitcoin Research Institute is really to connect these two areas of research and development and bring Bitcoin together with a lot of the major advances in AI,” Ray explained. “There is an army of researchers and faculty out there, and we need [to bring] the best minds onto Bitcoin to make this a reality.” </p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lwqLXaYoavE" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><p>For additional areas of research, Ray noted the potential rise of Chaumin mints as a means of scaling bitcoin payments, as well as the need for secure prediction markets enabled by Bitcoin, an innovation that may lead to more efficient insurance and financial products. <br><br>Ray’s speech also acknowledged the legacy of academic achievements in computer science that have led to both the creation of Bitcoin and artificial intelligence, suggesting that the two will build upon this success in research to drive innovation across all sectors of the economy.<br><br>Watch Korok Ray’s speech on the MicroStrategy World: Bitcoin for Corporations Livestream hosted on the Bitcoin Magazine <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwqLXaYoavE">YouTube</a>, <a href="https://x.com/BitcoinMagazine/status/1785768340700692598">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7191534089848422400">LinkedIn</a>.</p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ <p>MicroStrategy revealed its latest innovation today, a decentralized identity (ID) platform built on the Bitcoin network, named MicroStrategy Orange, at the <a href="https://www.microstrategy.com/world-2024/bitcoin-for-corporations">MicroStrategy World: Bitcoin for Corporations 2024</a> event.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">JUST IN: MicroStrategy launches an enterprise platform for building decentralized identity applications on <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bitcoin?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Bitcoin</a> — MicroStrategy Orange 👀 <a href="https://t.co/P5PXz80kSD">pic.twitter.com/P5PXz80kSD</a></p>&mdash; Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) <a href="https://twitter.com/BitcoinMagazine/status/1785795672345583834?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 1, 2024</a></blockquote> <script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> <p>"Today, I'd like to introduce MicroStrategy Orange, which is an an enterprise platform for building decentralized identity applications on the Bitcoin blockchain," said Cezary Raczko, Executive Vice President at MicroStrategy. "The platform consists of three fundamental pieces. At the heart of it is a service cloud hosted that allows you to issue those identifiers to your users and your organization."</p><p>The unveiling of MicroStrategy Orange marks a new milestone in the integration of Bitcoin into enterprise solutions. This platform is designed to empower organizations to use and manage decentralized identity applications utilizing the Bitcoin blockchain, leveraging its robust security and immutability features.</p><p>Raczko further explained that this new innovation allows you to deploy prepackaged applications that runs on the MicroStrategy Orange platform. "The orange apps are what's going to be prepackaged, point solutions that address specific digital identify challenges," he said.</p><p>"We see a huge opportunity and this is just the beginning," the MicroStrategy EVP of Engineering said. "Custodial or non-custodial, the obvious thing is every Bitcoin wallet out there should incorporate the capability of creating a Bitcoin based digital identity. Many messaging platforms suffer from the same challenges that email does. When you get a text message, how do you know the person who sent you the text message...We would want to include an orange check for these different messaging platforms." </p><figure> <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA2MTM3MzAyOTk1NDQ0OTI1/screenshot-2024-05-01-at-62810pm.png" height="663" width="1200"> </figure> <p>"And the other opportunity we see and we want to pursue is integrating the digital identity based on Bitcoin with this bigger verifiable credential ecosystem which opens up another large number of very interesting use cases," Raczko concluded. "Where I can now credential my identity anchored to Bitcoin — with a university degree, with a course certification issued by a hyperscaler, with your medical record and present those and have those verified all in a decentralized way. But with the ultimate identity living and being anchored to the Bitcoin blockchain."</p><p>Earlier this year in February, MicroStrategy <a href="https://x.com/BitcoinMagazine/status/1755359921699205578">announced</a> itself as "the world's first Bitcoin development company" during a presentation. Since then, MicroStrategy Orange has been the first technological innovation involving Bitcoin that the business intelligence and software company has announced.</p><p>The full announcement of MicroStrategy Orange can be viewed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXQWj6P0P1k">here</a>.</p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nXQWj6P0P1k" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe> ]]>

<![CDATA[ <p><strong>Company Name:</strong> DEMAND</p><p><strong>Founders:</strong> Alejandro De La Torre and Filippo Merli</p><p><strong>Date Founded:</strong> 2023</p><p><strong>Location of Headquarters:</strong> Lisbon, Portugal and Florence, Italy</p><p><strong>Amount of Bitcoin in Treasury:</strong> “Currently being bootstrapped”</p><p><strong>Number of Employees:</strong> 2</p><p><strong>Website:</strong> <a href="https://www.dmnd.work/">https://www.dmnd.work/</a></p><p><strong>Public or Private?</strong> Private</p><p>Alejandro De La Torre is deeply concerned that Bitcoin mining is too centralized, and he’s on a mission to change that. This is why he started <a href="https://www.dmnd.work/">DEMAND</a>, a Bitcoin mining pool that puts power back in the hands of independent Bitcoin miners.</p><p>Before getting into how DEMAND works, though, it’s important to understand what De La Torre has learned from his time in the Bitcoin mining industry so as to better understand his motivation in starting DEMAND.</p><h2>De La Torre’s History In The Bitcoin Mining Space</h2><p>De La Torre has served as the VP of <a href="https://www.poolin.com/">Poolin</a>, one of the largest Bitcoin and crypto mining pools in the world, as well as the VP of Business Operations for <a href="http://btc.com">BTC.com</a>, which also operated its own Bitcoin mining pool. What he saw during his time in these two roles made him realize that there was little time to waste in decentralizing the Bitcoin mining landscape.</p><p>“The experience I had in the last pools made me realize that we needed a change in the mining pool industry and we needed it very, very quickly,” De La Torre told Bitcoin Magazine. “There's a very clear problem with centralization in mining pools today, and I was able to pinpoint that issue while working at BTC.com and Poolin.”</p><p>De La Torre went on to describe how many Bitcoin mining pools are now proxies for a larger pool, which he didn’t mention by name (it’s <a href="https://theminermag.com/news/2023-12-28/bitcoin-mining-pool-block-reward-antpool-hashrate/">Antpool</a>), and explained that such centralization has the power to seriously damage Bitcoin.</p><p>“The anchor pool is close to 50% of the network now. It allows for a 51% attack on the network, which would be catastrophic,” said De La Torre.</p><p>“I don’t think they would ever do it, but the possibility is there, which is already a huge red flag,” he added.</p><p>De La Torre also pointed out that such levels of centralization pose risks when it comes to network censorship, highlighting that it wouldn’t be difficult for this major pool to censor half of the transactions on the Bitcoin network.</p><p>The potential for censorship and a 51% attack “are a very clear and present danger that we have in Bitcoin right now,” according to De La Torre.</p><h2>Power To The Solo Miners</h2><p>In reaction to this, De La Torre and his business partner, Filippo Merli, <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/demand-launches-worlds-first-stratum-v2-bitcoin-mining-pool">launched DEMAND Pool</a> in November 2023 with the intention of putting the power back in the hands of solo miners.</p><p>DEMAND is the world’s first<a href="https://stratumprotocol.org/"> Stratum V2</a> mining pool. Stratum V2 is an open-source messaging protocol that enables miners and pools to communicate directly with each other, reducing mining infrastructure requirements compared to its previous iteration, and enabling solo miners to choose their own mining templates.</p><p>“Pools today are the ones who are in charge of building the blocks and adding the transactions into the blocks,” said De La Torre. “With Stratum V2 — with DEMAND — the miners themselves will be able to build the blocks and add the transactions that they want.”</p><p>Most filtering in mining pools today is done at the pool level, not the individual miner level. De La Torre understands that, especially in the wake of the introductions of protocols like Ordinals and Runes, miners want more control over what types of transactions they include in their blocks. And De La Torre believes miners should have this power, because it adds to the ethos of decentralization. He also added that DEMAND will accept any blocks sent to the pool.</p><p>“This gives me less power. That's what I want. I don't want the power. I'm done with that power,” said De La Torre. “I've had it before, and it's too much power in the hands of too few. And that's not what Bitcoin is. Bitcoin is decentralization, and this is furthering that.”</p><h2>Incentivizing Solo Miners</h2><p>De La Torre is aware that the odds of mining a block are against small-scale solo miners, but he doesn’t think they shouldn’t give finding one a shot, and he’s also created other ways to incentivize solo miners to come online.</p><p>“You’ve got to heat up your home during winter, right? Why not just use a Bitcoin miner as a heater?” said De La Torre.</p><p>“If you’re lucky, you hit a block and you just made your wife very happy,” he added with a laugh.</p><p>Solo miners who join DEMAND Pool will also have the option to sell the hash rate they produce on a marketplace, ensuring that they receive some income for their efforts. DEMAND has set up a deal with the hash rate marketplace <a href="https://rigly.io/">Rigly</a> and plans to establish more partnerships.</p><p>De La Torre also touched on how DEMAND payments will be done via the PPLNS (Pay Per Last N Share) system. With PPLNS, profits are allocated based on the number blocks a mining pool mines per day and payouts fluctuate based on the pool’s luck in mining blocks.</p><p>This system differs from the FPPS (Full Pay Per Share) system, which is commonly used in the major mining pools. With FPPS, the mining service charge and block reward are settled based on theoretical profit, and miners get paid whether the pool finds a block or not.</p><p>De La Torre is aware that it may sound attractive to miners to get paid consistently with FPPS, but he was quick to point out that payouts through both PPLNS and FPPS are comparable over the long term.</p><p>“A lot of people have some misunderstandings about PPLNS,” said De La Torre.</p><p>“FPPS gives you constant payouts, which is fine. I understand why a miner would find FPPS. However, PPLNS over enough time averages out to about the same,” he added. </p><p>“Yes, you won't have constant payouts, but you will have incorrect payouts according to how much hash rate DEMAND has — and we intend to have a good amount. You will still be getting a constant payout, or it would average out to more or less the same. So, there's no real downside to it.”</p><p>De La Torre also pointed out that solo mining as part of DEMAND’s pool is one of the best ways for Bitcoin enthusiasts to get their hands on non-KYC bitcoin.</p><p>He also stressed the fact that solo miners’ coming online will do something else that’s vital to keeping Bitcoin decentralized — it will bring more nodes online.</p><h2>Send Nodes</h2><p>To use DEMAND’s block templates, miners have to run their own nodes. This means that solo miners would not only contribute to the decentralization of Bitcoin’s hash rate but also to the decentralization of its governance.</p><p>“Not only do we want the solo community and the home mining community to flourish and to make more money, but we also want node proliferation,” said De La Torre.</p><p>“Solo miners will provide hash rate to secure the network and potentially make some bitcoin and also help with maintaining Bitcoin Core or whatever Bitcoin client they want. Nodes are good for the health of the system,” he added.</p><h2>Looking Ahead</h2><p>De La Torre also said that DEMAND is currently working on expanding its services to pooled mining, and that DEMAND will actively be looking for miners to come on board.</p><p>He’s vowed to make DEMAND a “stable and trustworthy pool with transparent payouts,” differentiating it from the “black box” pools out there.</p><p>De La Torre seems to be doing everything in his power to bring more independent miners online, and as he laid out his plans for DEMAND in my conversation with him, there was a palpable sense of urgency in his voice.</p><p>“The centralization of Bitcoin mining pools is becoming a very serious issue, and it's up to us as the mining community to do something about it,” said De La Torre. “If we don’t, it’s not good.”</p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ <p>Is OP_CAT happening? The covenants proposal was just assigned BIP number #347. But before we delve deeper, let’s explore what covenants are and why Bitcoiners may want them.</p><p>Is Bitcoin an ideal state of digital e-cash or do we want more from our coins on-chain?</p><h2>Scratching the Surface: Bitcoin Scripts Limitations</h2><p>To understand covenant proposals like OP_CAT, it's crucial to grok the fundamental limitations of Bitcoin Script as it is today. Under the hood, Bitcoin allows for the creation of basic smart contracts through codes that define the rules for locking and unlocking funds. However, Bitcoin Script, as a programming language, is fairly limited to basic logic that comes into play only when moving coins in a new transaction.</p><p><em>In Bitcoin today there is no way to pre-configure or dictate your coins' transaction paths, or how fast coins can move at the time they’re being locked up (aside from hacky workflows using PSBT, partially signed bitcoin transactions, which cannot properly include transaction fees, prove deletion if unused, or prevent broadcasting later).</em></p><p>This simplicity, while core to Bitcoin's security model, introduces significant limitations in the scripting language’s ability to support even basic smart contracts.</p><h2>Linear Execution Model</h2><p>One limitation of Bitcoin Script is its operational model where opcodes are executed sequentially with no loops.</p><figure> <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA2MTI3NzIyMjY1NTg0ODI5/script.png" height="267" width="1200"> </figure> <p>From this example of a P2PKH transaction, you can see how the script executes linearly: duplicating the public key, hashing it to an address, verifying the hash against the lock script, and finally checking the signature against the public key.</p><p>The absence of looping means that scripts are not Turing complete and are guaranteed to terminate, preventing issues like infinite loops that could potentially halt or significantly slow down the network. While this design choice allows resource usage to be statically bounded, it also limits Script’s capability to manage complex workflows.</p><h2>Lack of Basic Arithmetic</h2><p>Bitcoin Script has just under 100 nontrivial opcodes, and somewhat surprisingly there is no ability to multiply, divide, or combine objects on the stack. As many users interested in OP_CAT will know, Satoshi <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/4bd188c4383d6e614e18f79dc337fbabe8464c82">disabled several opcodes in Bitcoin in 2010</a>, including OP_OR, OP_MUL (multiply), OP_DIV (divide), and OP_CAT (concatenate) among others. The disabled opcodes were removed because their original implementations had exploitable vulnerabilities that could compromise the network's security. But the absence of these opcodes makes it difficult to do basic math, which could be useful in simple scenarios like calculating transaction fees in a contract.</p><h2>Lack of Transaction Data Visibility</h2><p>Superficially, I think most people assume that Bitcoin smart contracts are able to see value amounts and any other parts of transaction data, since this information is already publicly viewable on the blockchain. But contrary to this assumption, contracts on Bitcoin are not able to set spend conditions based on transaction data, because Bitcoin Script has a very limited ability to see into transaction data at all.</p><p>If script had the ability to interpret more details within transaction data, we could build much more robust contracts that could do all the fun things like enforce specific spending conditions, create multi-stage transactions, and enable more advanced security features like vaults.</p><h2>What do we do about it?</h2><p>We know Bitcoin has these limitations, and over the years many different proposals have been discussed to introduce (or in some cases reintroduce) this functionality. Broader experiments with Bitcoin Script, such as Simplicity and others, aim to provide an alternative to stack-based constraints. Opcodes like OP_MULTISHA256, OP_LESS, and OP_LE32TOLE64 aim to upgrade Bitcoin's arithmetic abilities. Proposals like OP_CTV and OP_CAT that deal with <a href="https://glossary.blockstream.com/introspection-opcodes/">introspection opcodes</a> are grouped under the term covenants.</p><p>So what exactly is the difference between smart contracts and new term covenants?</p><h3>Smart Contracts vs. Covenants</h3><p>Smart contracts are self-executing transactions that transfer funds without intermediaries. In Bitcoin today, the smart contracts are limited to the act of locking and unlocking bitcoin with Bitcoin Script. Covenants aim to enhance Bitcoin's smart contracts functionality by enabling users to control how their funds are spent in future transactions.</p><p>By enabling Script to interpret transaction data, we effectively create a way for that data to be used in contract logic.</p><p>These are just some of the more interesting introspection opcodes for covenants functionality:</p><ol><li>OP_TXHASH: Provides the hash of a transaction’s inputs (or outputs), and gives Script the ability to verify and enforce conditions based on transaction data.</li><li>OP_CSFS + OP_CAT: The two together allow scripts to check signatures against any data, not just the transaction itself. This means Script can verify conditions based on transaction data or external information, expanding the possibilities for validation within Bitcoin scripts.</li></ol><p>These two opcodes are intentionally broad, enabling complex validation processes and introspection capabilities. Others are more narrow in scope and are designed to be a more limited form of covenants.</p><ol><li>OP_CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY (CTV): Allows a transaction output to embed a template of a future spending transaction, enabling covenants in a more constrained way.</li><li>OP_VAULT: Enables a specific form of covenant used for “vaulting”, which lets users specify a transaction destination but not actually move coins except after a delay.</li></ol><p>Then there is OP_CAT on its own, which is not directly an introspection opcode…</p><ol><li>OP_CAT: Enables Script to concatenate two elements on the stack, which is useful for combining different pieces of information within a script.</li></ol><p>OP_CAT doesn’t seem to have any introspection abilities, so what’s going on here?</p><h2>OP_CAT: Unraveling All of the Possibilities</h2><h3>Transaction Introspection</h3><p>In 2021, Andrew Poelstra wrote about <a href="https://blog.blockstream.com/cat-and-schnorr-tricks-i/">OP_CAT introspection tricks in a blog post</a>. He provided specific examples but presumed readers had prior knowledge of similar techniques. Here, I'll aim to simplify that explanation for better understanding.</p><p>In Bitcoin Script, there are only three primary opcodes that allow you to introspect the transaction data: CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY, CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY, and CHECKSIG. Additionally, there are variants like CHECKSIGVERIFY, CHECKSIGADD, CHECKMULTISIG, and CHECKMULTISIGVERIFY, which are essentially minor variations of CHECKSIG. The first two only let you see if the check is verified, providing a fairly narrow functionality. CHECKSIG is similar, but the difference here is that it allows you to grab the signature and the public key on the stack. Interesting.</p><p>Traditionally, we think of concatenation as a function that joins two items together, but we can also use it to separate or split an item, in this case—the signature into an (r, s) pair.</p><p>How do we derive OP_SPLIT functionality from OP_CAT?</p><blockquote><p>“If you have some big object you can split it into two by asking the user to spend time to provide the two pieces. You CAT them together and check equality basically. You can always invert every operation this way. With CAT by itself you can break apart signatures.” — Andrew Poelstra, <a href="https://btctranscripts.com/tabconf/2021/2021-11-05-jeremy-rubin-andrew-poelstra-covenants/">TABConf 2021</a></p></blockquote><p>What is happening here?</p><p>By requiring the user to provide the signature, public key, and transaction, you can split the signature into its component parts, then checking each part independently against the transaction data. This technique can be viewed as a form of splitting or combining, as it validates that the signature and public key are indeed the components of a valid transaction.</p><p>How does all this get us introspection?</p><blockquote><p>“In Taproot where we have Schnorr signatures using OP_CAT and the Schnorr signature verification opcode it turns out that it is possible to get a form of non-recursive covenant where you literally get a transaction hash. Not even like a funny mangled transaction hash but a literal SHA2 hash of all the transaction data onto the stack.” — Andrew Poelstra, <a href="https://btctranscripts.com/tabconf/2021/2021-11-05-jeremy-rubin-andrew-poelstra-covenants/">TABConf 2021</a></p></blockquote><p>Poelstra goes on to demonstrate how you can get a SHA2 hash for transaction inputs or outputs left on the stack. We’ll skip the moon math here, but the implication is that with OP_CAT we can constrain parts of a transaction as a requirement of the unlocking script. We can constrain the send address or value being sent of that transaction, where the transaction hash serves as the key to unlock it.</p><h4>Vaults</h4><p>Using the same techniques give us transaction introspection and quickly give us a basic version of vaults. Following the logic outlined in Poelstra’s blog, a developer by the name of Rijndael proved that we can do this with OP_CAT alone in his implementation of <a href="https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/basic-vault-prototype-using-op-cat/576">Purrfect Vaults</a>.</p><blockquote><p>“Re-building a TXID on the stack to introspect previous transactions was actually easier than I expected.” — Rijndael</p></blockquote><p>With vaults, users specify the next address that their funds must go to, providing mechanisms for fund recovery in case of key compromise, and reducing the incentive for private key theft.</p><h4>Merkle Trees for Script</h4><p>In Bitcoin today, Merkle Trees are the data structure used for data verification, synchronization, and more or less ‘chaining’ the blockchain's transactions and blocks together. The OP_CAT opcode, which enables the concatenation of two stack variables, when used alongside SHA256 hashes of public keys, facilitates a straightforward Merkle tree verification process for scripts. This approach, initially proposed by Pieter Wuille in 2015, was successfully implemented in the Liquid network.</p><p>Imagine a tree structure brimming with various spending conditions, such as hash preimages, timelocks, and public keys, known as tree signatures.</p><h4>Tree Signatures</h4><p>OP_CAT enables the creation of Tree Signatures which:</p><blockquote><p>“...Provide a multisignature script whose size can be logarithmic in the number of public keys and can encode spend conditions beyond n-of-m. For instance, a transaction less than 1KB in size could support tree signatures with a thousand public keys. This also enables generalized logical spend conditions.” — BIP author Ethan Heilman, on the <a href="https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2023-October/022049.html">bitcoin-dev mailing list</a></p></blockquote><p>This would enable the validation of any hashed content within the tree, maintaining data integrity and trustworthiness without adding unnecessary bulk or bloat to the blockchain.</p><p>What is interesting about all of this?</p><h3>Recursive Covenants</h3><p>If you have the ability to examine a transaction and apply constraints to certain parts of it, you can set up conditions that carry over through multiple transactions, effectively creating a chain of ongoing restrictions. This concept is called a recursive covenant. OP_CAT is a unique proposal because it gives us so much power for just 10 new lines of code. It has the ability to address all three of the initial limitations we covered at the onset of the post: transaction data visibility, better math functionality, and its linear execution model.</p><p>While OP_CAT may seem straightforward at first, it unlocks significant potential when leveraged creatively. It serves as a building block for even more functionality way beyond the scope of this discussion, like Post-Quantum Lamport Signatures.</p><h4>Is This Safe?</h4><p>Before OP_CAT was initially removed, when combined with OP_DUP (duplicate), and used repetitively to duplicate an initially-1-byte value on the stack, memory usage could be made to explode. This could have been used as a denial-of-service (DoS) attack as a result of increased memory consumption. The new proposal trivially prevents this attack by imposing a 520-byte limit on stack elements.</p><p>Is there a danger of a contract running forever?</p><p>If by this we mean, does OP_CAT change the execution model of Script to mean that it no longer statically bounds its resource usage (as a linear function of the Script size)? No.</p><p>Would covenants create a market for other coins on top of Bitcoin?</p><p>If you have a recursive covenant, yes, you can technically build up complex layer-2 applications, including NFTs, decentralized exchanges, and quantum cats. However, doing so is not trivial. It’s hard to see any serious markets do so.</p><p>Can you permanently "taint" coins by using CAT?</p><p>In the case of colored coins and NFTs, issuing these assets the user effectively 'burns' a satoshi, marking it in a way that signifies ownership of the ‘layer-2’ asset. This process is known as 'tainting' coins. But only the owner of a coin can mark their coin, and Bitcoin wallets will no longer recognize it (unless their authors explicitly add code to enable this). The resulting coins would not be accepted by bitcoin wallets. Probably they would be accepted by cryptocat wallets or something like that, but this is irrelevant to most bitcoin users.</p><p>Would this create an MEV problem on Bitcoin?</p><p>A key point of distinction between Bitcoin and Ethereum is transaction visibility. Unlike Ethereum, not all aspects of the contract are necessarily transparent, meaning that Bitcoin miners don’t have the same ability to see internal contract state and front-run them.</p><p>The main concern of OP_CAT by economically minded Bitcoiners is the potential for Miner Extractable Value (MEV). As discussed more extensively in my <a href="https://blog.blockstream.com/miner-extractable-value-mev-and-programmable-money-the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly/">previous post on the subject</a>. Many users are concerned that if we make layer-2 contracts technically possible, MEV will become inevitable. But is this true? Specifically, does the technical feasibility of layer-2 coins on Bitcoin imply their inevitable creation and adoption?</p><p>You could imagine building simple swap contracts or comparatively inefficient NFTs, but building up something as complex as DEXs with automatic market makers seems extremely unlikely and is not ever something we’ve seen on Liquid despite the ‘technical possibility’ for it.</p><h2>So is OP_CAT really perfect?</h2><p>Hardly, far from it. Some folks would love to see recursive covenants, while others simply don’t want to see Bitcoin change at all.</p><p>A faction of Bitcoiners, "ossificationists", advocate for preserving Bitcoin in its current state and view any protocol upgrades with skepticism. They are particularly concerned that significant changes, like the introduction of covenants, could undermine the network's decentralization. Their argument hinges on the belief that it's best to stick closely to Bitcoin's original vision. The irony being that OP_CAT was initially part of Bitcoin, fuels a counterargument. Some believe that bringing OP_CAT back could actually realign Bitcoin with Satoshi's initial vision.</p><p>If you'd like to see some of the security features that recursive covenants could make possible, OP_CAT would be nice, but definitely not as nice as a full-blown Lisp-esque scripting language. The problem here being that this would be a massive change to Bitcoin, that’s not likely to find its footing anytime soon.</p><p>Or maybe, you're on the other end, and you’d prefer the simplicity of non-recursive like OP_CTV or OP_VAULT. Non-recursive covenants are simpler and easier to reason about, without the risk of creating an uncontrolled chain of constraints.</p><p>What if some version of recursive covenants were inevitable?</p><p>Over the years, developers have noticed that almost any extension to the transaction validation logic could be used to emulate the functionality of OP_CAT.</p><p>In the Script universe, there are two realms, based on the size of the stack elements. For stack elements larger than 4 bytes, you can compare for equality, interpret as a key a signature, or hash it. For stack elements less than or equal to 4 bytes, you can treat them as objects to do arithmetic or branching. With a RISC-V processor running on a BitVM, you can do literally anything. Anything that allows you to emulate OP_CAT, break stack elements up, or concatenate them together brings these two realms together, so that you can ‘do anything’ with Script.</p><p>Researchers like Andrew Poelstra expect we could do recursive covenants with pretty much any new opcode. If true, that would be a justification for working towards a way to do them well.</p><p>Is OP_CAT the likely path forward for covenants?</p><p>If covenants are not just interesting, but inevitable, how do we ensure it's implemented in such a way that gets more Bitcoin users sending trustlessly like Satoshi originally envisioned? While ossificationists remain divided, still OP_CAT continues to ascend as a strong contender in the covenants debate.</p><p>OP_CAT is not the most elegant chisel, but it's one with the best ratio of power to complexity, that would allow developers to carve up some amazing new features.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Kiara Bickers.

<![CDATA[ <p>Roger Ver, a prominent early investor in Bitcoin and famously dubbed “Bitcoin Jesus,” has been indicted by the Department of Justice (DOJ) on charges of mail fraud, tax evasion, and filing false tax returns. Ver was arrested over the weekend in Spain based on these criminal charges, and the U.S. intends to seek his extradition for trial.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">JUST IN: 🇺🇸 US DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE ARRESTS EARLY <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/BITCOIN?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#BITCOIN</a> INVESTOR ROGER VER, CHARGED WITH TAX EVASION <a href="https://t.co/KdShrow0PS">pic.twitter.com/KdShrow0PS</a></p>&mdash; Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) <a href="https://twitter.com/BitcoinMagazine/status/1785379846425616800?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 30, 2024</a></blockquote> <script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> <p>The indictment alleges that Ver, formerly of Santa Clara, California, owned and operated MemoryDealers.com Inc. and Agilestar.com Inc., both of which were involved in selling computer and networking equipment. Starting in 2011, Ver purportedly began acquiring bitcoins for himself and his companies, amassing a significant amount by 2014, totaling around 131,000 bitcoins with a value of approximately $240 million.</p><p>Ver then obtained citizenship in St. Kitts and Nevis in 2014 and renounced his U.S. citizenship shortly thereafter, in a process known as expatriation.

<![CDATA[ <p>Remember that movie where Sandra Bullock crosses the entire country blindfolded because peaking outside means you’re basically facing a certain death? <br><br>That must be how it feels to build anything in Bitcoin right now. </p><p>Everyone is just moving blind. The United States government is taking everyone along for the ride and no one knows where we’re headed. There are no instructions you can read, and no rules to follow. You move an inch in the wrong direction, you make one unfortunate shitpost, or maybe you tweet at Elizabeth Warren on her bad day. You get your head chopped off. </p><p>Imagine you’re one of the Samourai Wallet developers. One day, you decide enough is enough and take the blindfold off. You make a concerted effort to <a href="https://twitter.com/SamouraiWallet/status/1749784171239657472">engage with the regulators</a> and bring two dozen of your peers on board. You pay top dollar and hire the best lawyers in the industry to help everyone see through the regulatory fog. </p><p>Four months later, <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/two-arrested-alleged-conspiracy-launder-45-billion-stolen-cryptocurrency">chopped</a>. </p><p>Beyond the human tragedy unfolding here, this should be a cathartic moment for the industry. <br><br>We’ve spent the last decade trying to get into the good graces of regulators. We’ve asked permission, laid out red carpets and practically begged for consideration. Millions of dollars were donated to lobbyists and many more were put to work by any company seeking to do business with United States citizens. <br><br>If last week is any indication, it was all for naught.</p><p>Did you think only shitcoins get you rugged? </p><p>Sure, the Samourai guys seem like easy pickings. Inflammatory personalities and bombastic statements are enough to convince the casual observer that they are guilty, if only of wrong-think. Openly challenging the government and inciting individuals to take control of their financial privacy appears to be a criminal offense these days. <br><br>Even in Bitcoin circles, “moderates” argued that well… they were brash meanies so they probably deserved it. As far as they’re concerned, there is no need to overreact. </p><p>“Nothing to see here.”</p><p>Back in the real world, your head starts spinning once you begin reading the indictment. The language is flimsy. <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/legal/samourai-did-nothing-wrong-self-custodial-tools-are-not-money-transmitters">The technical concepts are bastardized</a>. Even the most sensationalized charges are incredibly tenuous. One loose Twitter DM, a rather vague presentation slide, and a casual shitpost. Given the defendant’s history, I’m actually astounded they couldn’t conjure up something more incriminating. Maybe they have a couple of aces up their sleeves but at first glance, none of it adds up. </p><p>That is until you zoom out and look at the whole picture. What if the reality distortion field is intentional? What if Keonne Rodriguez and William Hill are the fall guys for something far bigger than them? </p><p>We don’t have to guess. There is no conspiracy required here. The day following the Samourai team’s arrest, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York laid it all out in the open. In their case against Tornado Cash developer Roman Storm, US attorneys submitted their <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.604938/gov.uscourts.nysd.604938.53.0.pdf">response</a> to the defense’s appeal to dismiss, <a href="https://twitter.com/sethforprivacy/status/1784298343755055214">and boy is it a doozy</a>. Not only were we operating blindly, but it is argued everyone has been breaking the law the whole time. A decade of FinCEN guidance? Irrelevant.</p><p>Under the terms set in this document, every Bitcoin transaction probably ought to be KYC’d. Peer-to-peer software is unlawful and self-custody should be prohibited. </p><h2>Criminal intent</h2><p>Don’t fall for the cheap tricks of high-profile cases and punk-rock developers. The United States government is not trying to prosecute criminals, it is seeking to reset the rules of the game and redefine the law so that everyone who doesn’t have a license to operate is deemed a criminal. <br><br>It is not just Samourai Wallet or Tornado Cash that is on trial. It is your financial freedom as well.<br></p><p>Of course, those amongst us who make a living out of kissing politicians’ feet and have enough of a regulatory moat will try to convince you otherwise. You aren’t lobbying hard enough, they will say. They probably genuinely believe that, if worst comes to worst, we’ll also vote ourselves out of that one. </p><p>Some are already heeding the warning shots. On Friday, ACINQ, creators of the Phoenix Lightning wallet, announced that they were pulling their product from the US app stores. </p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Recent announcements from US authorities cast a doubt on whether self-custodial wallet providers, Lightning service providers, or even Lightning nodes could be considered Money Services Businesses and be regulated as such.</p>&mdash; ACINQ (@acinq_co) <a href="https://twitter.com/acinq_co/status/1783878732865740940?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 26, 2024</a></blockquote> <script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> <p>Others are calling the government’s bluff and <a href="https://twitter.com/evankaloudis/status/1783892634982859039">taking a stand</a>. Refusing to serve US customers might work in the short term to reduce one’s liabilities but it also feels like kicking the can down the road. The precedent that could be set in this case presents the genuine risk of being used by other countries as a basis for similar policies. Give them an inch here and they’ll take a mile.<br><br>The fight has been brought to us and must be responded to in kind. The rule of law is being challenged. Courts are being weaponized. For Americans, this is a battle for constitutional rights. For the rest of the world, this is a cautionary tale. <br><br>For Bitcoiners, this is an opportunity to let go of the divisive rhetoric and align against the actual enemy at hand, the State.</p><blockquote><p><em>pigeons : you live in a place where fighting back worked. the rest of us live in the rest of the world where we got crushed.<br>mircea_popescu : that is a good point, yes.<br>mircea_popescu : but I intend to hold up that legacy.</em></p></blockquote> ]]>

<![CDATA[ <p>The world witnessed unprecedented power grabs and supply chains disruptions over the past couple of years. The almost perfect alignment between big government, big banks and corporations should be a serious cause for concern across the agricultural sector. These moves represent no less than the most serious threats to our freedom and survival as businesses, probably even as individuals. If you stand for resilience and biodiversity, bitcoin should be a natural fit. Bitcoin ultimately protects biodiversity. </p><p>Concentration of power and money had started long before the COVID hysteria took over the world. Corporatization of the agricultural sector has been my main concern long before the legalization hype started. We all knew, deep inside that the cannabis space had this potential of becoming the ugliest manifestation of big ag, big tobacco and big pharma, all at once. It's happening right before our very eyes and a lot of us feel helpless about this trend. While most in the industry have struggled to obtain the most basic financial services any legitimate business is entitled to, a parallel financial system emerged and is now representing a very serious alternative to the broken legacy system. Let's dissect a bit what our options are and how they support our dream vision for the cannabis industry, medicinal plants, but also for the entire agricultural sector.</p><h2>The broken legacy system</h2><p>We are familiar with the central bank-managed, credit-based scheme that creates money out of thin air, unfairly distributed across the economy, mainly towards insiders, while the pleb receives crumbs to survive on and pays interests to crony banksters. Consumers and businesses alike take ever more credit to get ahead and acquire the assets they need to prosper or sometimes, sadly, to simply satisfy advertising-induced cravings. Sustaining a <em>capital intensive</em> cultivation operation in these conditions is a real challenge. Add the regulatory burden and you've got a perfect recipe for family business destruction. </p><p>You may be wondering how monetary policy, plant breeding and plant patents relate. Well, the fiat system fosters an annuitant scheme, where concentration of power and resources becomes the norm and where artificial moats prevent any new competitor from entering the market to provide better options to society. Cronyism goes hand in hand with predatory proprietary tactics. In order to pay their debt back or deliver expected returns to investors,<a href="https://blog.strainly.io/2018/04/22/breeders-rights-and-the-preservation-of-cannabis-cultivars-part-2/"> innovators need to acquire exclusive rights over biology (e.g. plant varieties) to grab unjustified and unreasonable margins for long periods of time over a newly bred varietal</a>. At scale, this system incentivizes breeders to limit access to their cultivars, preventing any other breeder from improving the genetic pool which ultimately destroys biodiversity by creating single points of failure in the preservation effort. It also fosters predatory practices on farmers and growers who face hefty fines and penalties for inadvertently breaching patents when growing such proprietary varietals. Ask corn and cotton farmers who got rekt by Bayer, Syngenta or Dupont after their fields were cross-pollinated with proprietary pollen from neighboring fields during windy days…<br><br>Let me pause to clarify something. Patents on technology can absolutely be legitimate to enable returns on capital intensive R&D. However, patents on <em>biology </em>are unethical for 2 main reasons: </p><ol><li>They tap into an existing genetic pool that sits in the public domain, sometimes called “commons” (i.e. Big Ag initially used public domain varietals to breed patented varietals)</li><li>They incentivize GMO development and ultimately, transhumanism</li></ol><p><br>In the agricultural world, it seems the more central banks print money, the more concentrated markets become and the less innovation hits the market. In the context of plant breeding, biodiversity is inversely correlated to money supply, where fiat encourages sterile monocropping. Despite these growing predatory proprietary practices, debt levels are at an all-time high across the cannabis industry. Most of these zombie corporations will never repay their debt. The house of cards will harm many in its fall, including humble players who built the entire space, such as family businesses. </p><p>The cannabis industry has been consolidating at a concerning pace in the past few years. Canada and California are far from the legalization dream many of us had. Legacy farms are being forced out of the market and low quality corporate mids(cannabis of not the best quality) sprayed with synthetic terpenes (i.e artificial flavors) flood the market. We are all familiar with this race to the bottom pattern. </p><p>There should be room for high quality craft products. Such products are difficult to bring to market in a fiat-based system that requires ever larger economies of scales and upfront capital. Instead of consolidating the industry based on capital expenditure into artificial moats such as plant patents, a bitcoin-centric industry would fairly reward craft producers for the quality they bring to market, not their moats.</p><p>If you are a human-scale player and want to make a living from your passion for the plant, what are the best tools at hand? You should already know that<a href="https://blog.strainly.io/2019/07/31/open-source-cannabis-breeding-part-3/"> open-source breeding is the most suited IP strategy for small breeders</a>. You don't want to fight the patent war with your limited means; against crony corporations sitting right next to the money printer. But how can you win the open-source game using unfit fiat money? Well, here’s come Bitcoin.</p><h2>The new paradigm: sound money</h2><p>Sound money is salable across space, time and scale, it adequately stores value for their hard-working holders, while respecting their privacy. It's value-creators’ money, not annuitants’. It's the adequate money for rewarding breeders who improve and maintain the genetic pool that ultimately benefits consumers. It's scarce money that creates the conditions of abundance and biodiversity. But how? </p><p>Imagine being paid for your work in a currency that appreciates in time and preserves the value of your work, in other words, of the energy you expend to grow plants, select phenotypes, breed new seeds, select and package them. Imagine a currency that allows you to transact with people anywhere in the world, without asking permission from anyone and without doxxing you. That's quite a revolution for growers and breeders who have been denied banking services and had to rely on cash to settle transactions, with all the risks pertaining to it. </p><p>Bitcoin is trustless, permissionless and instant transaction settlement between parties. It allows breeders and growers to live off of their passion, what they do best: farming and breeding. Breeders shouldn’t have to play the litigation game to enforce patents and defend their annuities to keep up with inflation and pay interest on printed money. Those who resorted to doing so usually regret it when they realize they can't win at Big Ag's game; after all the rules of the proprietary game are written by and for the cantillionaires. Small and medium size businesses cannot win this game in the long run because patent enforcement requires substantial cash-flows. Engaging in the plant patent game is a sure way to sell out down the road, or simply being pushed out of the market by bigger players. </p><p>Any entrepreneur thriving for financial autonomy and ultimately for freedom wants to convert their expended energy into hard money. With bitcoin, the incentive to compromise biodiversity to maximize annuities in order to compensate for melting fiat money disappears. With bitcoin, breeders and growers can focus on their craft, while storing the fruits of their work for the long term in the soundest money that exists. Bitcoin therefore allows for many small players to be part of the agricultural sector: it encourages anti-fragility, competition, and biodiversity.</p><p>This is not the only problem bitcoins solves for the cannabis industry. Transaction settlement has been a central issue. Excluded from the traditional banking system, too many legally operating businesses have had to rely on cash to settle transactions. Sitting on piles of cash in today's world is impractical and indeed dangerous. Meanwhile these same businesses are paying taxes like any other. Taxation without financial representation. Bitcoin fixes this. By its trustless non-intermediated nature, bitcoin allows cannabis businesses to settle transactions in a secured way, while not relying on banks or payment processors. Who wants to pay onerous processing fees and beg for basic services to financial institutions that despised this industry for years? Why not turn this hurdle into a competitive advantage? Instead of jumping through hoops to be accepted into the dying legacy system, the entire cannabis industry should migrate to bitcoin and get ahead of the game, ultimately creating the blueprint for the agricultural sector at large. </p><p><em>This is a guest post by Remnantal.

<![CDATA[ <p>Last week <a href="https://filecache.mediaroom.com/mr5mr_paypal/186970/Green_Mining_Initiative_2024.pdf">Paypal released a whitepaper</a> in partnership with Energy Web and DMG Blockchain Solutions, describing a “Green Mining Initiative” intended to redirect fees from participating users specifically to certified miners powering their operations with renewable energy. I can’t say I’m surprised by this honestly, mining has at this point become very normalized in terms of its use to further renewable energy or climate goals. Mining is actually very suited to this task given its nature, miners are mercenaries looking for the cheapest energy possible to devote towards solving the next block. If you have stranded power, or excess power, they will take it. </p><p>The overall architecture of this system though is beyond the territory of Rube Goldberg. I am kind of amazed that this is the level of technical understanding and sophistication that a major company like Paypal has on tap, especially in their Blockchain Research Group specifically focusing on this space. The entire thing is inefficient, absurd, and some of the end goals or possibilities they discuss are not built upon sound economic incentives. </p><h2>The Core Design</h2><p>The entire gist of the design is to ensure that when a compliant user broadcasts a transaction to the network, only a certified green miner can collect the associated transaction fee. The problem with this is that mining fees from a transaction are collectible from any miner who includes them in a block, not just certified ones. A mechanism is required to guarantee only certain miners can collect a few. </p><p>The first thing you have to do is identify which miners you want to be capable of claiming the restricted fee. They propose utilizing a system called “Green Proofs for Bitcoin” offered by Energy Web. The proofs are certifications from the organization that a miners energy mix or impact on the grid meets some threshold of renewable energy use or positive impact on the power grid. In the certification process each miner can register a public key, creating a list of each certified miners public key. </p><p>This key certification is at the root of what enables ensuring only the correct miners can claim a fee. Compliant users’ wallets can query or be provided with a list of all certified miners bitcoin addresses, and from there have the information needed to create a special transaction that only they can claim the fee for. The trick is a multisig output. There are no hard limits of how many keys need to sign for a multisig address, so compliant users can include the fee to certified miners in a special output with a 1-of-n multisig script that any certified miner can spend. A minimal fee at the bottom of the mempool feerate range is also included traditionally just to ensure that it propagates across the network. </p><p>The last piece of the puzzle is actually claiming the fee. If a certified miner was to mine a block including a green transaction, and not also include a transaction spending the fee output to themselves, then <em>any</em> certified miner could claim the fee output in the next block they mine. There, for each green transaction a certified miner includes in their block, they must include a corresponding transaction sending the fee output to an address only they hold a key for. </p><p>Special wallets can craft transactions with fee outputs only claimable by certified miners, and these users can preferentially direct their fees towards miners certified as using renewable energy or creating some other positive impact on the grid. </p><h2>Full of holes and incomplete thinking</h2><p>Firstly, the general idea of requiring miners to include a second transaction of their own is an incredibly inefficient design, which they do acknowledge in the paper. What they don’t acknowledge is the economic realities this implies for transactions’ feerates. </p><p>A Bitcoin transaction pays fees based on the amount of space it takes up in terms of data. By introducing the need for miners to take up blockspace creating a secondary transaction collecting this “green fee” they are economically speaking increasing the size of the green transaction itself. This is very similar in practice to Child-Pays-For-Parent from an economic perspective. </p><p>With CPFP, a transaction spending an output from an unconfirmed transaction pays an abnormally high fee. This by averaging the fee the second transaction pays across both itself and the first transaction, which must be confirmed before the second one can be, increases the feerate of the first transaction. This green fee collection mechanism is the same dynamic, but in reverse. </p><p>By requiring the miners to craft a second transaction to claim the fee, assuming the fee output pays an average feerate, the net fees the miner collects per byte of data is actually lowered. The blockspace required to collect it could have been used to include another fee paying transaction. So in reality, the fee a compliant user includes for certified miners must also pay for the miner’s claim transaction, in effect meaning compliant users have to pay more absolute fees to achieve a specific fee rate. Why would users do this?</p><p>In a vacuum this dynamic guarantees that either compliant users have to overpay, or certified miners wind up actually making less revenue all things equal. The former is irrational from a consumer point of view, and the latter completely fails to achieve the goal of rewarding miners using renewables extra revenue. </p><p>A second glaring issue, and an amazing one, is their thinking of how to structure the 1-of-n multisig script. With traditional pre-Taproot multisig, each individual key in the multisig must be present in the script. This presents a problem. The size of the green fee output grows linearly for each miner who has a key in the multisig. </p><p>The plan laid out in the paper describes breaking miners up into subgroups, and rotating between which group you pay fees to each time you transact. I.e. if there are 21 miners, split them up into 3 groups of 7, moving to the next group to send the fees to each time you transact. This would create a highly irregular distribution of fees between all the certified miners, as the rate of transactions amongst compliant users and rate of rotation between them is not something that can be prescribed or made regular. Not to mention, it seemingly shows a complete lack of awareness of Schnorr based multisig schemes like FROST. </p><p>Schnorr based multisig scripts use aggregate keys, meaning no matter how many member keys are involved, only a single public key is needed for the script, and only a single signature is required. This would completely address the issue of multisig script size, and do away with the requirement for the clunk breaking up of certified miners into subgroups. </p><p>They also make no mention of more efficient mechanisms for actually collecting the fee. A single secondary transaction for each green transaction is mind blowingly inefficient. An <em>very</em> obvious mechanism to be more efficient with use of blockspace would be to sweep all of the green transaction fee outputs in a single transaction. This would require only a single transaction output to aggregate all of the fees into a single UTXO, rather than a discrete output for each individual fee, and also creating the need to combine them with yet another transaction later. </p><p>They finally go on to discuss the potential of a centralized out of band mechanism directly to certified miners, but bring up the centralization, introduction of trust, and complexity of implementing direct communication to each individual miner as reasons for designing the distributed protocol described above. </p><h2>The Market Alright Does This</h2><p>At the end of the day, the technical inefficiencies and lack of grasping blatantly obvious solutions (at least partially) to them, aren’t even the most confounding part of this to me. It’s attempting to insert incentive distorting dynamics into the application layer of the protocol to address the concern over renewable energy in the first place. Why? The market literally handles this incentive all by itself. </p><figure> <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA2MDg0MTg5ODE5MzE1MjI2/electricity_costs_in_dollars_according_to_data_from_lazard.png" height="582" width="1200"> <figcaption><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Electricity_costs_in_dollars_according_to_data_from_Lazard.png">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Electricity_costs_in_dollars_according_to_data_from_Lazard.png</a></figcaption> </figure> <p>Renewable energy is the cheapest energy even when taking into account the cost of construction and operation of energy production capacity. Miners chief concern is finding the lowest priced energy they possibly can. Why is Paypal trying to interject weird systems giving users a distortionary mechanism to restrict fees only to certain miners, and overall introduce a distortionary market mechanism into this picture? <em>The market already does what you want</em>. Renewable energy is cheap, build more of it and miners will come and buy it, bringing revenue to finance the operation (especially when it is initially disconnected from the grid and has no other consumers).</p><p>The entire dynamic of fees in Bitcoin is that it is a completely open market, where <em>any</em> miner can compete to collect fees from <em>any</em> transaction by including them in their own blocks. This entire dynamic is built to incentivize maximal competition between miners to provide security and finality to users of the network. Trying to introduce weird distortions like this proposal into the system is a destabilizing factor in the balance of competition and network security, <em>and is completely redundant given the market realities of the mining ecosystem</em>. </p><p>Do you want to see Bitcoin mining be a positive factor in incentivizing and helping expand renewable energy production? Great! It already does that, no changes needed. It does not need Rube Goldberg machinations slapped on top to accomplish that goal, the inherent market based mechanisms of competition between miners already does that. </p><p>I really don’t understand what Paypal, DMG, and Energy Web are thinking here. </p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ <p>On Wednesday, the founders of the Bitcoin privacy wallet Samourai Wallet were arrested and charged on behalf of the US Government. The indictment could set dangerous precedents beyond Bitcoin privacy services.</p><blockquote><p>“If your government is worried about their own citizens controlling their money, the most important question you have to ask is ‘what the hell is wrong with my government’”</p><p>– Andreas Antonopolous</p></blockquote><p>Last wednesday, Samourai Wallet founders Keonne Rodriguez and William Hill were arrested and charged with conspiracy to money laundering and conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money service business in the Southern District Court of New York. The indictment <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.615996/gov.uscourts.nysd.615996.4.0.pdf">alleges</a> that Samourai Wallet “facilitated more than $100 Million in money laundering transactions from illegal dark web markets”.</p><p>The definition of a non-custodial wallet as a money service business and the consequent indictment of the wallet’s maintainers can set dangerous precedents for the wider Bitcoin space and may go as far as affecting the freedom of the internet, essentially endangering all individuals, organizations and technologies involved in the transfer of financial transactions without exercising control over funds.</p><h2>Can a non-custodial wallet be a money service business?</h2><p><a href="https://www.fincen.gov/sites/default/files/2019-05/FinCEN%20Guidance%20CVC%20FINAL%20508.pdf">FinCEN’s 2019 guidance</a> on persons administering, exchanging, or using virtual currencies, define a money transmitter as a “person that provides money transmission services,” or “any other person engaged in the transfer of funds.” As the guidance states, “a transmitter initiates a transaction that the money transmitter actually executes.”</p><p>The guidance further states that “the term “money transmission services” is defined to mean the acceptance of currency, funds, or other value that substitutes for currency from one person and</p><p>the transmission of currency, funds, or other value that substitutes for currency to another location or person by any means.”</p><p>As a non-custodial Bitcoin wallet, Samourai Wallet’s operators do not take custody of user funds and therefore are technically incapable to “accept” deposits or “execute” the transmission of funds, contrarily to what is alleged by prosecutors, stating that "Samourai engaged in the unlicensed receipt</p><p>and transmission of funds, including funds deposited into a Samourai wallet by an undercover law enforcement agent located in the Southern District of New York."</p><p>However, technically speaking, the agent deposited funds into an application running locally on his device, with no engagement from Samourai operators – a circumstance correctly noted by prosecutors throughout the indictment, stating that “the private keys for these cryptocurrency addresses are stored in each user's individual cell phone”, that “these private keys are not shared with Samourai employees,” and that "the Samourai software on the user's cellphone will broadcast a transaction to the blockchain."</p><p>The indictment yet alleges that Samourai Wallet “facilitates transactions between Samourai users” – a claim that seems blatantly incorrect in the face of the fact that coinjoin transactions do not facilitate transactions between users at all, but rather create a shared transaction in which every user spends their own funds to themselves.</p><p>The indictment further repeatedly alleges that Samourai creates "new addresses" used during the transactions, and that “The Samourai server is responsible” for broadcasting transactions – claims which, too, are technically incorrect as transactions are created solely on the users device and Samourai only broadcasts transactions on behalf of users if users choose to broadcast their transactions via Samourai’s node. For anyone running their own node with Samourai Wallet, known as “Dojo”, transactions are broadcast by users themselves.</p><p>Numbers provided by the node provider Ronin Dojo suggest that up to 85% of Whirlpool users run their own Dojo. It is questionable whether organized criminals would rely on nodes provided by Samourai Wallet as its operators would effectively be enabled to deanonymize transactions by gaining knowledge of users' extended publickeys, a design choice often criticized in Samourai Wallet’s architecture. Notably, the indictment makes no mention of “Dojo” at all.</p><h2>DoJ Challenges FinCEN Guidelines</h2><p>The indictment against Samourai appears to suggest that the DoJ does not believe FinCEN guidelines apply as reflected in the language used to describe Samourai's services, in which prosecutors note the broadcasting of transactions, the operation of a centralized server, and the subsequent collection of fees from the services offered: </p><p>"The Samourai server is responsible for broadcasting the Ricochet transactions to the BTC network [...] From Whirlpool and Ricochet, RODRIGUEZ and HILL earned at least $4 million in fees"</p><p>The DoJ's arguments appear more in line with recent <a href="https://www.fatf-gafi.org/content/dam/fatf-gafi/guidance/Updated-Guidance-VA-VASP.pdf.coredownload.inline.pdf">recommendations</a> issued by the financial action task force. FATF, an intergovernmental body established by the G7 in 1989 to combat money laundering and terrorist financing risks, is not a regulatory body, but the task force’s recommendations are known to form the basis of informing AML/CFT regulations around the world.</p><p>In recommendations issued in 2021, FATF expands the definition of virtual asset service providers as “decentralized exchanges or platforms” which “have a central party with some measure of involvement or control," such as developing "user interfaces for accounts holding an administrative "key"" or "collecting fees.”</p><p>By the logic put forward by FATF, it appears that the development of any individual, organization or technology interfacing with financial transactions could require a money service business license. Notably, a new AML package adopted by the European Parliament last week aimed at updating current AML regulations in accordance with FATF recommendations, specifically exempted self-custodial services.</p><p>Similar attempts to circumvent FinCEN guidelines are currently being made on the Tornado Cash case. In <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.604938/gov.uscourts.nysd.604938.53.0.pdf">an opposition</a> issued on April 26th, prosecutors argue that the definition of money transmitting "does not require the money transmitter to have “control” of the funds being transferred," highlighting that Section 1960 of US Code, a codification of permanent federal laws, extends the definition of money transmitting to “transferring funds on behalf of the public by any and all means.”</p><p>As interpreted by the department of justice, AT&T would require a money service business license to allow customers access to their PayPal, an ISP would need a money service business license to allow users to access online banking services, a postman would require a money service business license to deliver cash in mail, a grocer would need a money service business license to hand out change, and Telegram, WhatsApp, Signal and X (formerly Twitter) would require a money service business license if users utilize the platform to share PSBTs or lightning invoices – subsequently deeming all such services to require full know your customer verification.</p><h2>Can the Bitcoin Network be KYCed?</h2><p>The indictment has sent ripples through the Bitcoin ecosystem, leaving anyone involved in the broadcasting of Bitcoin transactions in uncertainty, including bitcoin miners and node operators. The non-custodial Lightning wallet Phoenix has since <a href="https://twitter.com/acinq_co/status/1783878732865740940">announced</a> the suspending operations in the US. The privacy-first Bitcoin wallet Wasabi Wallet has <a href="https://blog.wasabiwallet.io/zksnacks-now-blocking-u-s-residents-and-citizens/">banned US users</a> from accessing its services and software.</p><p>Reading the indictment, it appears as though everything we knew about the regulatory aspects of money transmission may have been misapplied, as the indictment appears to go as far as to attempt the criminalization of self-spending. As the indictment reads, self-spends, as evident in coinjoins and Samourai's Ricochet, "further obscure ownership of the funds.” But any Bitcoin wallet allows users to generate self-spends and essentially circumvent blockchain surveillance mechanisms and censorship, further muddying regulatory waters.</p><p>The foundations to introduce KYC to the Bitcoin network have been researched as early as 2016 with the <a href="https://petertodd.org/2016/mit-chainanchor-bribing-miners-to-regulate-bitcoin">MIT ChainAnchor</a> project, which explored the introduction of identities and permission groups to blockchains, preventing non-registered users from having transactions mined in blocks.</p><p>With increasing miner centralization, with around 47% of hashrate’s mining rewards custodied <a href="https://x.com/mononautical/status/1777686545715089605">by a single custodian</a>, including the pools of AntPool, F2Pool, Binance Pool, Braiins, btcom, SECPOOL, and Poolin, plans to KYC the Bitcoin network may not seem too far fetched. In 2023, F2Pool already began <a href="https://b10c.me/observations/08-missing-sanctioned-transactions/?t">censoring transactions</a> in line with the OFAC sanctions list. </p><p>Since the indictment of the Samourai founders, the FBI has <a href="https://www.ic3.gov/Media/Y2024/PSA240425">issued a PSA</a> concerning cryptocurrency money service businesses, alerting the public to avoid services which do not require know your customer information. </p><p>If the non-custodial operation of services is ruled to classify as money transmission, the doors could be open to KYCing any service operating communication protocols, from Nostr to WiFi hotspots and telecommunication providers. If spun ad absurdum, it could even be argued to require the registration of KYC for the use of highways or the purchase of briefcases.</p><p>Plans to KYC the internet have been around since as early as 2014, when the US Government attempted to introduce a "drivers license for the internet," similar to the planned introduction of digital identities around the world.</p><p>It should be noted that the treatment of Samourai founders, who are currently serving pre-trial detention, stands in no comparison to the handling of financial crime allegations around the world. Since 2000, traditional financial institutions, such as UBS, JP Morgan, and Bank of America, <a href="https://violationtracker.goodjobsfirst.org/?parent=&major_industry_sum=&primary_offense_sum=&agency_sum=&hq_id_sum=&company_op=starts&company=&major_industry%5B%5D=financial+services&case_category=&all_offense%5B%5D=&penalty_op=%3E&penalty=&govt_level=&agency_code%5B%5D=&pen_year%5B%5D=&pres_term=&free_text=&case_type=&ownership%5B%5D=&hq_id=&naics%5B%5D=&state=&city&order=pen_year&sort=asc&page=1">have been fined over $380 Billion</a>. The argument that traditional banks are primarily used for legal transactions can also be applied to Samourai Wallet, as the indictment <a href="https://x.com/sethforprivacy/status/1783647623255134405">reportedly</a> only alleges the transmission of illicit funds of 3.6% of Samourai’s total transaction volume, leaving 96.4% of legitimate usage. </p><p>The Samourai case has been assigned to judge Richard M. Berman, who previously presided over the the Jeffrey Epstein case. In 2005, Berman <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/02/nyregion/police-searches-of-bags-in-subways-are-ruled-constitutional.html">ruled</a> that random police searches of riders bags on the New York City subway did not violate the U.S. constitution. </p><p><em>This is a guest post by L0la L33tz.

<![CDATA[ <p>Remember that movie where Sandra Bullock crosses the entire country blindfolded because peaking outside means you’re basically facing a certain death? <br><br>That must be how it feels to build anything in Bitcoin right now. </p><p>Everyone is just moving blind. The United States government is taking everyone along for the ride and no one knows where we’re headed. There are no instructions you can read, and no rules to follow. You move an inch in the wrong direction, you make one unfortunate shitpost, or maybe you tweet at Elizabeth Warren on her bad day. You get your head chopped off. </p><p>Imagine you’re one of the Samourai Wallet developers. One day, you decide enough is enough and take the blindfold off. You make a concerted effort to <a href="https://twitter.com/SamouraiWallet/status/1749784171239657472">engage with the regulators</a> and bring two dozen of your peers on board. You pay top dollar and hire the best lawyers in the industry to help everyone see through the regulatory fog. </p><p>Four months later, <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/two-arrested-alleged-conspiracy-launder-45-billion-stolen-cryptocurrency">chopped</a>. </p><p>Beyond the human tragedy unfolding here, this should be a cathartic moment for the industry. <br><br>We’ve spent the last decade trying to get into the good graces of regulators. We’ve asked permission, laid out red carpets and practically begged for consideration. Millions of dollars were donated to lobbyists and many more were put to work by any company seeking to do business with United States citizens. <br><br>If last week is any indication, it was all for naught.</p><p>Did you think only shitcoins get you rugged? </p><p>Sure, the Samourai guys seem like easy pickings. Inflammatory personalities and bombastic statements are enough to convince the casual observer that they are guilty, if only of wrong-think. Openly challenging the government and inciting individuals to take control of their financial privacy appears to be a criminal offense these days. <br><br>Even in Bitcoin circles, “moderates” argued that well… they were brash meanies so they probably deserved it. As far as they’re concerned, there is no need to overreact. </p><p>“Nothing to see here.”</p><p>Back in the real world, your head starts spinning once you begin reading the indictment. The language is flimsy. <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/legal/samourai-did-nothing-wrong-self-custodial-tools-are-not-money-transmitters">The technical concepts are bastardized</a>. Even the most sensationalized charges are incredibly tenuous. One loose Twitter DM, a rather vague presentation slide, and a casual shitpost. Given the defendant’s history, I’m actually astounded they couldn’t conjure up something more incriminating. Maybe they have a couple of aces up their sleeves but at first glance, none of it adds up. </p><p>That is until you zoom out and look at the whole picture. What if the reality distortion field is intentional? What if Keonne Rodriguez and William Hill are the fall guys for something far bigger than them? </p><p>We don’t have to guess. There is no conspiracy required here. The day following the Samourai team’s arrest, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York laid it all out in the open. In their case against Tornado Cash developer Roman Storm, US attorneys submitted their <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.604938/gov.uscourts.nysd.604938.53.0.pdf">response</a> to the defense’s appeal to dismiss, <a href="https://twitter.com/sethforprivacy/status/1784298343755055214">and boy is it a doozy</a>. Not only were we operating blindly, but it is argued everyone has been breaking the law the whole time. A decade of FinCEN guidance? Irrelevant.</p><p>Under the terms set in this document, every Bitcoin transaction probably ought to be KYC’d. Peer-to-peer software is unlawful and self-custody should be prohibited. </p><h2>Criminal intent</h2><p>Don’t fall for the cheap tricks of high-profile cases and punk-rock developers. The United States government is not trying to prosecute criminals, it is seeking to reset the rules of the game and redefine the law so that everyone who doesn’t have a license to operate is deemed a criminal. <br><br>It is not just Samourai Wallet or Tornado Cash that is on trial. It is your financial freedom as well.<br></p><p>Of course, those amongst us who make a living out of kissing politicians’ feet and have enough of a regulatory moat will try to convince you otherwise. You aren’t lobbying hard enough, they will say. They probably genuinely believe that, if worst comes to worst, we’ll also vote ourselves out of that one. </p><p>Some are already heeding the warning shots. On Friday, ACINQ, creators of the Phoenix Lightning wallet, announced that they were pulling their product from the US app stores. </p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Recent announcements from US authorities cast a doubt on whether self-custodial wallet providers, Lightning service providers, or even Lightning nodes could be considered Money Services Businesses and be regulated as such.</p>&mdash; ACINQ (@acinq_co) <a href="https://twitter.com/acinq_co/status/1783878732865740940?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 26, 2024</a></blockquote> <script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> <p>Others are calling the government’s bluff and <a href="https://twitter.com/evankaloudis/status/1783892634982859039">taking a stand</a>. Refusing to serve US customers might work in the short term to reduce one’s liabilities but it also feels like kicking the can down the road. The precedent that could be set in this case presents the genuine risk of being used by other countries as a basis for similar policies. Give them an inch here and they’ll take a mile.<br><br>The fight has been brought to us and must be responded to in kind. The rule of law is being challenged. Courts are being weaponized. For Americans, this is a battle for constitutional rights. For the rest of the world, this is a cautionary tale. <br><br>For Bitcoiners, this is an opportunity to let go of the divisive rhetoric and align against the actual enemy at hand, the State.</p><blockquote><p><em>pigeons : you live in a place where fighting back worked. the rest of us live in the rest of the world where we got crushed.<br>mircea_popescu : that is a good point, yes.<br>mircea_popescu : but I intend to hold up that legacy.</em></p></blockquote> ]]>

<![CDATA[ <p>The world witnessed unprecedented power grabs and supply chains disruptions over the past couple of years. The almost perfect alignment between big government, big banks and corporations should be a serious cause for concern across the agricultural sector. These moves represent no less than the most serious threats to our freedom and survival as businesses, probably even as individuals. If you stand for resilience and biodiversity, bitcoin should be a natural fit. Bitcoin ultimately protects biodiversity. </p><p>Concentration of power and money had started long before the COVID hysteria took over the world. Corporatization of the agricultural sector has been my main concern long before the legalization hype started. We all knew, deep inside that the cannabis space had this potential of becoming the ugliest manifestation of big ag, big tobacco and big pharma, all at once. It's happening right before our very eyes and a lot of us feel helpless about this trend. While most in the industry have struggled to obtain the most basic financial services any legitimate business is entitled to, a parallel financial system emerged and is now representing a very serious alternative to the broken legacy system. Let's dissect a bit what our options are and how they support our dream vision for the cannabis industry, medicinal plants, but also for the entire agricultural sector.</p><h2>The broken legacy system</h2><p>We are familiar with the central bank-managed, credit-based scheme that creates money out of thin air, unfairly distributed across the economy, mainly towards insiders, while the pleb receives crumbs to survive on and pays interests to crony banksters. Consumers and businesses alike take ever more credit to get ahead and acquire the assets they need to prosper or sometimes, sadly, to simply satisfy advertising-induced cravings. Sustaining a <em>capital intensive</em> cultivation operation in these conditions is a real challenge. Add the regulatory burden and you've got a perfect recipe for family business destruction. </p><p>You may be wondering how monetary policy, plant breeding and plant patents relate. Well, the fiat system fosters an annuitant scheme, where concentration of power and resources becomes the norm and where artificial moats prevent any new competitor from entering the market to provide better options to society. Cronyism goes hand in hand with predatory proprietary tactics. In order to pay their debt back or deliver expected returns to investors,<a href="https://blog.strainly.io/2018/04/22/breeders-rights-and-the-preservation-of-cannabis-cultivars-part-2/"> innovators need to acquire exclusive rights over biology (e.g. plant varieties) to grab unjustified and unreasonable margins for long periods of time over a newly bred varietal</a>. At scale, this system incentivizes breeders to limit access to their cultivars, preventing any other breeder from improving the genetic pool which ultimately destroys biodiversity by creating single points of failure in the preservation effort. It also fosters predatory practices on farmers and growers who face hefty fines and penalties for inadvertently breaching patents when growing such proprietary varietals. Ask corn and cotton farmers who got rekt by Bayer, Syngenta or Dupont after their fields were cross-pollinated with proprietary pollen from neighboring fields during windy days…<br><br>Let me pause to clarify something. Patents on technology can absolutely be legitimate to enable returns on capital intensive R&D. However, patents on <em>biology </em>are unethical for 2 main reasons: </p><ol><li>They tap into an existing genetic pool that sits in the public domain, sometimes called “commons” (i.e. Big Ag initially used public domain varietals to breed patented varietals)</li><li>They incentivize GMO development and ultimately, transhumanism</li></ol><p><br>In the agricultural world, it seems the more central banks print money, the more concentrated markets become and the less innovation hits the market. In the context of plant breeding, biodiversity is inversely correlated to money supply, where fiat encourages sterile monocropping. Despite these growing predatory proprietary practices, debt levels are at an all-time high across the cannabis industry. Most of these zombie corporations will never repay their debt. The house of cards will harm many in its fall, including humble players who built the entire space, such as family businesses. </p><p>The cannabis industry has been consolidating at a concerning pace in the past few years. Canada and California are far from the legalization dream many of us had. Legacy farms are being forced out of the market and low quality corporate mids(cannabis of not the best quality) sprayed with synthetic terpenes (i.e artificial flavors) flood the market. We are all familiar with this race to the bottom pattern. </p><p>There should be room for high quality craft products. Such products are difficult to bring to market in a fiat-based system that requires ever larger economies of scales and upfront capital. Instead of consolidating the industry based on capital expenditure into artificial moats such as plant patents, a bitcoin-centric industry would fairly reward craft producers for the quality they bring to market, not their moats.</p><p>If you are a human-scale player and want to make a living from your passion for the plant, what are the best tools at hand? You should already know that<a href="https://blog.strainly.io/2019/07/31/open-source-cannabis-breeding-part-3/"> open-source breeding is the most suited IP strategy for small breeders</a>. You don't want to fight the patent war with your limited means; against crony corporations sitting right next to the money printer. But how can you win the open-source game using unfit fiat money? Well, here’s come Bitcoin.</p><h2>The new paradigm: sound money</h2><p>Sound money is salable across space, time and scale, it adequately stores value for their hard-working holders, while respecting their privacy. It's value-creators’ money, not annuitants’. It's the adequate money for rewarding breeders who improve and maintain the genetic pool that ultimately benefits consumers. It's scarce money that creates the conditions of abundance and biodiversity. But how? </p><p>Imagine being paid for your work in a currency that appreciates in time and preserves the value of your work, in other words, of the energy you expend to grow plants, select phenotypes, breed new seeds, select and package them. Imagine a currency that allows you to transact with people anywhere in the world, without asking permission from anyone and without doxxing you. That's quite a revolution for growers and breeders who have been denied banking services and had to rely on cash to settle transactions, with all the risks pertaining to it. </p><p>Bitcoin is trustless, permissionless and instant transaction settlement between parties. It allows breeders and growers to live off of their passion, what they do best: farming and breeding. Breeders shouldn’t have to play the litigation game to enforce patents and defend their annuities to keep up with inflation and pay interest on printed money. Those who resorted to doing so usually regret it when they realize they can't win at Big Ag's game; after all the rules of the proprietary game are written by and for the cantillionaires. Small and medium size businesses cannot win this game in the long run because patent enforcement requires substantial cash-flows. Engaging in the plant patent game is a sure way to sell out down the road, or simply being pushed out of the market by bigger players. </p><p>Any entrepreneur thriving for financial autonomy and ultimately for freedom wants to convert their expended energy into hard money. With bitcoin, the incentive to compromise biodiversity to maximize annuities in order to compensate for melting fiat money disappears. With bitcoin, breeders and growers can focus on their craft, while storing the fruits of their work for the long term in the soundest money that exists. Bitcoin therefore allows for many small players to be part of the agricultural sector: it encourages anti-fragility, competition, and biodiversity.</p><p>This is not the only problem bitcoins solves for the cannabis industry. Transaction settlement has been a central issue. Excluded from the traditional banking system, too many legally operating businesses have had to rely on cash to settle transactions. Sitting on piles of cash in today's world is impractical and indeed dangerous. Meanwhile these same businesses are paying taxes like any other. Taxation without financial representation. Bitcoin fixes this. By its trustless non-intermediated nature, bitcoin allows cannabis businesses to settle transactions in a secured way, while not relying on banks or payment processors. Who wants to pay onerous processing fees and beg for basic services to financial institutions that despised this industry for years? Why not turn this hurdle into a competitive advantage? Instead of jumping through hoops to be accepted into the dying legacy system, the entire cannabis industry should migrate to bitcoin and get ahead of the game, ultimately creating the blueprint for the agricultural sector at large. </p><p><em>This is a guest post by Remnantal.

<![CDATA[ <p>On a <a href="https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/04/29/alliance-resource-partners-arlp-q1-2024-earnings-c/">Q1 earnings call</a> yesterday, Alliance Resource Partners, a coal mining company worth $2.8 billion that trades under the ticker ARLP on the Nasdaq, reported that it’s mining bitcoin and currently holding 425 BTC on its balance sheet.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Nasdaq listed Alliance Resources <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24ARLP&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">$ARLP</a>, a $2.8b coal mining company, is mining <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/bitcoin?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#bitcoin</a>, and currently holds 425 <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24BTC&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">$BTC</a> on its balance sheet. <br><br>The company has additionally adopted the new FASB accounting standards for its holdings. <a href="https://t.co/uZomhnuBPz">pic.twitter.com/uZomhnuBPz</a></p>&mdash; Dylan LeClair 🟠 (@DylanLeClair_) <a href="https://twitter.com/DylanLeClair_/status/1785106188712943993?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 30, 2024</a></blockquote> <script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> <p>“In the second half of 2020, we started mining bitcoin as a pilot project to monetize already paid for yet underutilized electricity load at our River View mine,” said Cary Marshall, Senior Vice President and CFO of Alliance Resource Partners, on the call.</p><p>“Since then we have mined and now own bitcoin valued at approximately $30 million,” he added.</p><p>The $30 million figure comes from valuing each of the 425 BTC the company holds at approximately $70,500, the price at which bitcoin was trading toward the end of Q1 2024. After factoring in Alliance’s bitcoin mining expenses, the company saw a net profit of $7.3 million from Bitcoin mining in Q1.</p><p>The amount of Bitcoin Alliance holds ranks it 23rd on the <a href="https://bitcointreasuries.net/">list of companies</a> that hold bitcoin on their balance sheet. </p><p>Joe Craft, President and CEO of Alliance, pointed out on the call that the company isn’t necessarily pivoting to a bitcoin-centric strategy but, instead, approaching its bitcoin mining operation with a high degree of practicality.</p><p>“We are selling what we need to cover our expenses, so our exposure is limited,” said Craft.</p><p>“We do have some extra capacity that we're renting out to other Bitcoin miners within the data center that we've effectively built for this Bitcoin mining to take advantage of the low energy costs we have,” he added.</p><p>For more information on Alliance Resource Partners, visit the company’s <a href="https://www.arlp.com/">website</a>.</p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ <p>Last week <a href="https://filecache.mediaroom.com/mr5mr_paypal/186970/Green_Mining_Initiative_2024.pdf">Paypal released a whitepaper</a> in partnership with Energy Web and DMG Blockchain Solutions, describing a “Green Mining Initiative” intended to redirect fees from participating users specifically to certified miners powering their operations with renewable energy. I can’t say I’m surprised by this honestly, mining has at this point become very normalized in terms of its use to further renewable energy or climate goals. Mining is actually very suited to this task given its nature, miners are mercenaries looking for the cheapest energy possible to devote towards solving the next block. If you have stranded power, or excess power, they will take it. </p><p>The overall architecture of this system though is beyond the territory of Rube Goldberg. I am kind of amazed that this is the level of technical understanding and sophistication that a major company like Paypal has on tap, especially in their Blockchain Research Group specifically focusing on this space. The entire thing is inefficient, absurd, and some of the end goals or possibilities they discuss are not built upon sound economic incentives. </p><h2>The Core Design</h2><p>The entire gist of the design is to ensure that when a compliant user broadcasts a transaction to the network, only a certified green miner can collect the associated transaction fee. The problem with this is that mining fees from a transaction are collectible from any miner who includes them in a block, not just certified ones. A mechanism is required to guarantee only certain miners can collect a few. </p><p>The first thing you have to do is identify which miners you want to be capable of claiming the restricted fee. They propose utilizing a system called “Green Proofs for Bitcoin” offered by Energy Web. The proofs are certifications from the organization that a miners energy mix or impact on the grid meets some threshold of renewable energy use or positive impact on the power grid. In the certification process each miner can register a public key, creating a list of each certified miners public key. </p><p>This key certification is at the root of what enables ensuring only the correct miners can claim a fee. Compliant users’ wallets can query or be provided with a list of all certified miners bitcoin addresses, and from there have the information needed to create a special transaction that only they can claim the fee for. The trick is a multisig output. There are no hard limits of how many keys need to sign for a multisig address, so compliant users can include the fee to certified miners in a special output with a 1-of-n multisig script that any certified miner can spend. A minimal fee at the bottom of the mempool feerate range is also included traditionally just to ensure that it propagates across the network. </p><p>The last piece of the puzzle is actually claiming the fee. If a certified miner was to mine a block including a green transaction, and not also include a transaction spending the fee output to themselves, then <em>any</em> certified miner could claim the fee output in the next block they mine. There, for each green transaction a certified miner includes in their block, they must include a corresponding transaction sending the fee output to an address only they hold a key for. </p><p>Special wallets can craft transactions with fee outputs only claimable by certified miners, and these users can preferentially direct their fees towards miners certified as using renewable energy or creating some other positive impact on the grid. </p><h2>Full of holes and incomplete thinking</h2><p>Firstly, the general idea of requiring miners to include a second transaction of their own is an incredibly inefficient design, which they do acknowledge in the paper. What they don’t acknowledge is the economic realities this implies for transactions’ feerates. </p><p>A Bitcoin transaction pays fees based on the amount of space it takes up in terms of data. By introducing the need for miners to take up blockspace creating a secondary transaction collecting this “green fee” they are economically speaking increasing the size of the green transaction itself. This is very similar in practice to Child-Pays-For-Parent from an economic perspective. </p><p>With CPFP, a transaction spending an output from an unconfirmed transaction pays an abnormally high fee. This by averaging the fee the second transaction pays across both itself and the first transaction, which must be confirmed before the second one can be, increases the feerate of the first transaction. This green fee collection mechanism is the same dynamic, but in reverse. </p><p>By requiring the miners to craft a second transaction to claim the fee, assuming the fee output pays an average feerate, the net fees the miner collects per byte of data is actually lowered. The blockspace required to collect it could have been used to include another fee paying transaction. So in reality, the fee a compliant user includes for certified miners must also pay for the miner’s claim transaction, in effect meaning compliant users have to pay more absolute fees to achieve a specific fee rate. Why would users do this?</p><p>In a vacuum this dynamic guarantees that either compliant users have to overpay, or certified miners wind up actually making less revenue all things equal. The former is irrational from a consumer point of view, and the latter completely fails to achieve the goal of rewarding miners using renewables extra revenue. </p><p>A second glaring issue, and an amazing one, is their thinking of how to structure the 1-of-n multisig script. With traditional pre-Taproot multisig, each individual key in the multisig must be present in the script. This presents a problem. The size of the green fee output grows linearly for each miner who has a key in the multisig. </p><p>The plan laid out in the paper describes breaking miners up into subgroups, and rotating between which group you pay fees to each time you transact. I.e. if there are 21 miners, split them up into 3 groups of 7, moving to the next group to send the fees to each time you transact. This would create a highly irregular distribution of fees between all the certified miners, as the rate of transactions amongst compliant users and rate of rotation between them is not something that can be prescribed or made regular. Not to mention, it seemingly shows a complete lack of awareness of Schnorr based multisig schemes like FROST. </p><p>Schnorr based multisig scripts use aggregate keys, meaning no matter how many member keys are involved, only a single public key is needed for the script, and only a single signature is required. This would completely address the issue of multisig script size, and do away with the requirement for the clunk breaking up of certified miners into subgroups. </p><p>They also make no mention of more efficient mechanisms for actually collecting the fee. A single secondary transaction for each green transaction is mind blowingly inefficient. An <em>very</em> obvious mechanism to be more efficient with use of blockspace would be to sweep all of the green transaction fee outputs in a single transaction. This would require only a single transaction output to aggregate all of the fees into a single UTXO, rather than a discrete output for each individual fee, and also creating the need to combine them with yet another transaction later. </p><p>They finally go on to discuss the potential of a centralized out of band mechanism directly to certified miners, but bring up the centralization, introduction of trust, and complexity of implementing direct communication to each individual miner as reasons for designing the distributed protocol described above. </p><h2>The Market Alright Does This</h2><p>At the end of the day, the technical inefficiencies and lack of grasping blatantly obvious solutions (at least partially) to them, aren’t even the most confounding part of this to me. It’s attempting to insert incentive distorting dynamics into the application layer of the protocol to address the concern over renewable energy in the first place. Why? The market literally handles this incentive all by itself. </p><figure> <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA2MDg0MTg5ODE5MzE1MjI2/electricity_costs_in_dollars_according_to_data_from_lazard.png" height="582" width="1200"> <figcaption><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Electricity_costs_in_dollars_according_to_data_from_Lazard.png">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Electricity_costs_in_dollars_according_to_data_from_Lazard.png</a></figcaption> </figure> <p>Renewable energy is the cheapest energy even when taking into account the cost of construction and operation of energy production capacity. Miners chief concern is finding the lowest priced energy they possibly can. Why is Paypal trying to interject weird systems giving users a distortionary mechanism to restrict fees only to certain miners, and overall introduce a distortionary market mechanism into this picture? <em>The market already does what you want</em>. Renewable energy is cheap, build more of it and miners will come and buy it, bringing revenue to finance the operation (especially when it is initially disconnected from the grid and has no other consumers).</p><p>The entire dynamic of fees in Bitcoin is that it is a completely open market, where <em>any</em> miner can compete to collect fees from <em>any</em> transaction by including them in their own blocks. This entire dynamic is built to incentivize maximal competition between miners to provide security and finality to users of the network. Trying to introduce weird distortions like this proposal into the system is a destabilizing factor in the balance of competition and network security, <em>and is completely redundant given the market realities of the mining ecosystem</em>. </p><p>Do you want to see Bitcoin mining be a positive factor in incentivizing and helping expand renewable energy production? Great! It already does that, no changes needed. It does not need Rube Goldberg machinations slapped on top to accomplish that goal, the inherent market based mechanisms of competition between miners already does that. </p><p>I really don’t understand what Paypal, DMG, and Energy Web are thinking here. </p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ <p>On Wednesday, the founders of the Bitcoin privacy wallet Samourai Wallet were arrested and charged on behalf of the US Government. The indictment could set dangerous precedents beyond Bitcoin privacy services.</p><blockquote><p>“If your government is worried about their own citizens controlling their money, the most important question you have to ask is ‘what the hell is wrong with my government’”</p><p>– Andreas Antonopolous</p></blockquote><p>Last wednesday, Samourai Wallet founders Keonne Rodriguez and William Hill were arrested and charged with conspiracy to money laundering and conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money service business in the Southern District Court of New York. The indictment <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.615996/gov.uscourts.nysd.615996.4.0.pdf">alleges</a> that Samourai Wallet “facilitated more than $100 Million in money laundering transactions from illegal dark web markets”.</p><p>The definition of a non-custodial wallet as a money service business and the consequent indictment of the wallet’s maintainers can set dangerous precedents for the wider Bitcoin space and may go as far as affecting the freedom of the internet, essentially endangering all individuals, organizations and technologies involved in the transfer of financial transactions without exercising control over funds.</p><h2>Can a non-custodial wallet be a money service business?</h2><p><a href="https://www.fincen.gov/sites/default/files/2019-05/FinCEN%20Guidance%20CVC%20FINAL%20508.pdf">FinCEN’s 2019 guidance</a> on persons administering, exchanging, or using virtual currencies, define a money transmitter as a “person that provides money transmission services,” or “any other person engaged in the transfer of funds.” As the guidance states, “a transmitter initiates a transaction that the money transmitter actually executes.”</p><p>The guidance further states that “the term “money transmission services” is defined to mean the acceptance of currency, funds, or other value that substitutes for currency from one person and</p><p>the transmission of currency, funds, or other value that substitutes for currency to another location or person by any means.”</p><p>As a non-custodial Bitcoin wallet, Samourai Wallet’s operators do not take custody of user funds and therefore are technically incapable to “accept” deposits or “execute” the transmission of funds, contrarily to what is alleged by prosecutors, stating that "Samourai engaged in the unlicensed receipt</p><p>and transmission of funds, including funds deposited into a Samourai wallet by an undercover law enforcement agent located in the Southern District of New York."</p><p>However, technically speaking, the agent deposited funds into an application running locally on his device, with no engagement from Samourai operators – a circumstance correctly noted by prosecutors throughout the indictment, stating that “the private keys for these cryptocurrency addresses are stored in each user's individual cell phone”, that “these private keys are not shared with Samourai employees,” and that "the Samourai software on the user's cellphone will broadcast a transaction to the blockchain."</p><p>The indictment yet alleges that Samourai Wallet “facilitates transactions between Samourai users” – a claim that seems blatantly incorrect in the face of the fact that coinjoin transactions do not facilitate transactions between users at all, but rather create a shared transaction in which every user spends their own funds to themselves.</p><p>The indictment further repeatedly alleges that Samourai creates "new addresses" used during the transactions, and that “The Samourai server is responsible” for broadcasting transactions – claims which, too, are technically incorrect as transactions are created solely on the users device and Samourai only broadcasts transactions on behalf of users if users choose to broadcast their transactions via Samourai’s node. For anyone running their own node with Samourai Wallet, known as “Dojo”, transactions are broadcast by users themselves.</p><p>Numbers provided by the node provider Ronin Dojo suggest that up to 85% of Whirlpool users run their own Dojo. It is questionable whether organized criminals would rely on nodes provided by Samourai Wallet as its operators would effectively be enabled to deanonymize transactions by gaining knowledge of users' extended publickeys, a design choice often criticized in Samourai Wallet’s architecture. Notably, the indictment makes no mention of “Dojo” at all.</p><h2>DoJ Challenges FinCEN Guidelines</h2><p>The indictment against Samourai appears to suggest that the DoJ does not believe FinCEN guidelines apply as reflected in the language used to describe Samourai's services, in which prosecutors note the broadcasting of transactions, the operation of a centralized server, and the subsequent collection of fees from the services offered: </p><p>"The Samourai server is responsible for broadcasting the Ricochet transactions to the BTC network [...] From Whirlpool and Ricochet, RODRIGUEZ and HILL earned at least $4 million in fees"</p><p>The DoJ's arguments appear more in line with recent <a href="https://www.fatf-gafi.org/content/dam/fatf-gafi/guidance/Updated-Guidance-VA-VASP.pdf.coredownload.inline.pdf">recommendations</a> issued by the financial action task force. FATF, an intergovernmental body established by the G7 in 1989 to combat money laundering and terrorist financing risks, is not a regulatory body, but the task force’s recommendations are known to form the basis of informing AML/CFT regulations around the world.</p><p>In recommendations issued in 2021, FATF expands the definition of virtual asset service providers as “decentralized exchanges or platforms” which “have a central party with some measure of involvement or control," such as developing "user interfaces for accounts holding an administrative "key"" or "collecting fees.”</p><p>By the logic put forward by FATF, it appears that the development of any individual, organization or technology interfacing with financial transactions could require a money service business license. Notably, a new AML package adopted by the European Parliament last week aimed at updating current AML regulations in accordance with FATF recommendations, specifically exempted self-custodial services.</p><p>Similar attempts to circumvent FinCEN guidelines are currently being made on the Tornado Cash case. In <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.604938/gov.uscourts.nysd.604938.53.0.pdf">an opposition</a> issued on April 26th, prosecutors argue that the definition of money transmitting "does not require the money transmitter to have “control” of the funds being transferred," highlighting that Section 1960 of US Code, a codification of permanent federal laws, extends the definition of money transmitting to “transferring funds on behalf of the public by any and all means.”</p><p>As interpreted by the department of justice, AT&T would require a money service business license to allow customers access to their PayPal, an ISP would need a money service business license to allow users to access online banking services, a postman would require a money service business license to deliver cash in mail, a grocer would need a money service business license to hand out change, and Telegram, WhatsApp, Signal and X (formerly Twitter) would require a money service business license if users utilize the platform to share PSBTs or lightning invoices – subsequently deeming all such services to require full know your customer verification.</p><h2>Can the Bitcoin Network be KYCed?</h2><p>The indictment has sent ripples through the Bitcoin ecosystem, leaving anyone involved in the broadcasting of Bitcoin transactions in uncertainty, including bitcoin miners and node operators. The non-custodial Lightning wallet Phoenix has since <a href="https://twitter.com/acinq_co/status/1783878732865740940">announced</a> the suspending operations in the US. The privacy-first Bitcoin wallet Wasabi Wallet has <a href="https://blog.wasabiwallet.io/zksnacks-now-blocking-u-s-residents-and-citizens/">banned US users</a> from accessing its services and software.</p><p>Reading the indictment, it appears as though everything we knew about the regulatory aspects of money transmission may have been misapplied, as the indictment appears to go as far as to attempt the criminalization of self-spending. As the indictment reads, self-spends, as evident in coinjoins and Samourai's Ricochet, "further obscure ownership of the funds.” But any Bitcoin wallet allows users to generate self-spends and essentially circumvent blockchain surveillance mechanisms and censorship, further muddying regulatory waters.</p><p>The foundations to introduce KYC to the Bitcoin network have been researched as early as 2016 with the <a href="https://petertodd.org/2016/mit-chainanchor-bribing-miners-to-regulate-bitcoin">MIT ChainAnchor</a> project, which explored the introduction of identities and permission groups to blockchains, preventing non-registered users from having transactions mined in blocks.</p><p>With increasing miner centralization, with around 47% of hashrate’s mining rewards custodied <a href="https://x.com/mononautical/status/1777686545715089605">by a single custodian</a>, including the pools of AntPool, F2Pool, Binance Pool, Braiins, btcom, SECPOOL, and Poolin, plans to KYC the Bitcoin network may not seem too far fetched. In 2023, F2Pool already began <a href="https://b10c.me/observations/08-missing-sanctioned-transactions/?t">censoring transactions</a> in line with the OFAC sanctions list. </p><p>Since the indictment of the Samourai founders, the FBI has <a href="https://www.ic3.gov/Media/Y2024/PSA240425">issued a PSA</a> concerning cryptocurrency money service businesses, alerting the public to avoid services which do not require know your customer information. </p><p>If the non-custodial operation of services is ruled to classify as money transmission, the doors could be open to KYCing any service operating communication protocols, from Nostr to WiFi hotspots and telecommunication providers. If spun ad absurdum, it could even be argued to require the registration of KYC for the use of highways or the purchase of briefcases.</p><p>Plans to KYC the internet have been around since as early as 2014, when the US Government attempted to introduce a "drivers license for the internet," similar to the planned introduction of digital identities around the world.</p><p>It should be noted that the treatment of Samourai founders, who are currently serving pre-trial detention, stands in no comparison to the handling of financial crime allegations around the world. Since 2000, traditional financial institutions, such as UBS, JP Morgan, and Bank of America, <a href="https://violationtracker.goodjobsfirst.org/?parent=&major_industry_sum=&primary_offense_sum=&agency_sum=&hq_id_sum=&company_op=starts&company=&major_industry%5B%5D=financial+services&case_category=&all_offense%5B%5D=&penalty_op=%3E&penalty=&govt_level=&agency_code%5B%5D=&pen_year%5B%5D=&pres_term=&free_text=&case_type=&ownership%5B%5D=&hq_id=&naics%5B%5D=&state=&city&order=pen_year&sort=asc&page=1">have been fined over $380 Billion</a>. The argument that traditional banks are primarily used for legal transactions can also be applied to Samourai Wallet, as the indictment <a href="https://x.com/sethforprivacy/status/1783647623255134405">reportedly</a> only alleges the transmission of illicit funds of 3.6% of Samourai’s total transaction volume, leaving 96.4% of legitimate usage. </p><p>The Samourai case has been assigned to judge Richard M. Berman, who previously presided over the the Jeffrey Epstein case. In 2005, Berman <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/02/nyregion/police-searches-of-bags-in-subways-are-ruled-constitutional.html">ruled</a> that random police searches of riders bags on the New York City subway did not violate the U.S. constitution. </p><p><em>This is a guest post by L0la L33tz.
