With the right tool and the right query, anyone can obtain the majority or complete details about any activity on the network, including the overall network statistics.</p> <p dir="ltr">Blockchain explorers enable anyone to explore network data by simply entering transaction details, tokens, blocks, and more. On Solana, one of the most popular explorers is Solscan. </p> <h2 dir="ltr">What Is Solscan?</h2> <p dir="ltr">Solana is one of the largest smart contract blockchain networks and the fourth-largest crypto asset by market cap, at the time of writing. With a reported excess of 870,000 active wallets and over one million transactions executed on the network daily, it ranks amongst the busiest blockchain networks.</p> <p dir="ltr"><a href="https://solscan.io/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Solscan</a> keeps track of these activities and lets users obtain details about accounts, transactions, and decentralized applications on the network. Solscan was launched in 2021, and is one of Solana’s most popular blockchain explorers. </p> <p dir="ltr">Beyond providing information on network accounts and transactions, Solscan has also developed an analytics dashboard for the general state of the Solana network, featuring information on the network’s performance, and validator count. It also presents sector-specific dashboards for DeFi and NFT, providing information about applications and assets in each of these sectors. Solscan is a free-to-use application and users do not need to create an account or pay a fee to use the platform; however, to access extra features like <strong>Watch List</strong> and <strong>Notifications</strong>, you'll need to register for a free Solscan account. </p> <p dir="ltr">With Solscan, you can follow up with events on the Solana network in real-time. Here are some activities you can carry out on the Solscan platform.</p> <h2 dir="ltr">How to Look Up Transactions on Solscan</h2> <p dir="ltr">On Solscan, you can track details of transactions. This can be a random transaction, a pending network transaction, or other transactions of interest like whale movements.  </p> <p dir="ltr">To retrieve details of a transaction from the Solana network database using Solscan, you will need the transaction hash. This can be provided by the sender, or from your wallet application.</p> <p dir="ltr">The transaction hash is an alphanumeric string of this form: 8rtuTqqCe7iR98KndAbK8VkTMGKeWGiDZLHPuBagVHCsP2MP1qKUiAgWYi4gdc8bGgUpR4Cc5XgrHa6sk7Mt5tt</p> <p dir="ltr">With this data;</p> <ol> <li aria-level="1" dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Visit the <a href="https://solscan.io/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Solscan website</a>.</p> </li> <li aria-level="1" dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Paste the transaction hash into the search bar at the top of the page, and press Enter or click on the search result to view full details.</p> </li> </ol> <div dir="ltr"><img alt="Paste Solana transaction hash to search for transaction on Solscan" loading="lazy" src="https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/10195/content_Search_transaction.webp" style="width: 1200px; height: 333px;"></div> <ol start="3"> <li aria-level="1" dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr" role="presentation"> The transaction page shows details of the operation. </p> </li> </ol> <div dir="ltr"><img alt="Transaction search on Solscan" loading="lazy" src="https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/10196/content_transaction_search.webp" style="width: 1200px; height: 631px;"></div> <p dir="ltr">Each data allows you to preview the basic information about the transaction.</p> <p dir="ltr">Data obtainable from the transaction preview page on Solscan includes;</p> <p dir="ltr"><strong>Signature</strong>: The transaction hash</p> <p dir="ltr"><strong>Block</strong>: The hashcode of the network block that contains the transaction</p> <p dir="ltr"><strong>Timestamp</strong>: The recorded time for the transaction.</p> <p dir="ltr"><strong>Transaction Result</strong>: This states whether the transaction has been completed, failed, or is still being processed by the network. </p> <p dir="ltr">For failed transactions, a brief explanation will also be presented in this section.</p> <p dir="ltr"><strong>Signer</strong>: The Solana account that executed the transaction.</p> <p dir="ltr"><strong>Fee</strong>: The amount (in SOL) paid for the transaction to be processed on the network</p> <p dir="ltr"><strong>Transaction Actions</strong>: Details of the activities performed by the transaction request.</p> <p dir="ltr"><strong>Transaction Version</strong>: The transaction format (Legacy or Versioned).</p> <p dir="ltr"><strong>Previous Blockhash</strong>: The alphanumeric hashcode of the transaction block that precedes the searched transaction.</p> <p dir="ltr"><strong>Instruction Details</strong>: Actions of the transaction request, presented in code format.</p> <p dir="ltr"><strong>Program Log</strong>: Summary of the instruction details for each core stage of the transaction processing.</p> <p dir="ltr">You can also navigate to the Sol Balance Change or Token Balance Change (for SPL token transfers) to see how many tokens or coins each participant in the transaction has before and after the transaction.</p> <p dir="ltr">Besides transactions, you can also look up wallet addresses on Solscan.</p> <h2 dir="ltr">How to Look Up Wallet Addresses on Solscan</h2> <p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.coingecko.com/learn/top-solana-wallets" target="_blank">Solana wallet addresses</a> are user accounts on the network. The ledger account for each individual address contains details of every transaction performed and wallet balances at each time. Solscan enables users to retrieve details of each network account at any time by simply querying the network for this data via the Solscan interface.</p> <h3 dir="ltr">Reviewing Wallets on Solscan</h3> <p dir="ltr">Obtain the wallet address you wish to review. If this is your personal wallet, you can copy the address from your wallet application or from any other medium where they are saved or entered.</p> <p dir="ltr">This is the format for Solana network addresses: 9yMfSCUf749h54uGSHwHrgdhe5voXF94EBsHV4Sm24Pj</p> <ol> <li aria-level="1" dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr" role="presentation"> Visit the <a href="https://solscan.io/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Solscan platform</a>.</p> </li> <li aria-level="1" dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Paste the wallet address into the search bar at the top of the page.

The address page contains other sections with additional wallet data.</p> <p dir="ltr">Data obtainable from the wallet address page includes;</p> <p dir="ltr"><strong>SOL Balance</strong>: Amount of SOL coin held by the address at the time of query</p> <p dir="ltr"><strong>Token Balance</strong>: SPL tokens held by the address. Click on the dropdown to view individual token balances.</p> <p dir="ltr"><strong>Owner</strong>: The program base that controls the address access.</p> <p dir="ltr"><strong>isOnCurve</strong>: OnCurve addresses have <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/learn/what-are-public-and-private-keys" target="_blank">private keys</a>. If the account’s variable is set to True, then the account has a corresponding private key that controls access. Off-curve addresses do not have private keys.</p> <p dir="ltr"><strong>Stake</strong>: This shows the number of Solana coins staked by the account.</p> <p dir="ltr">You can also view the wallet's activity:</p> <p dir="ltr"><strong>Transactions</strong>: This section presents a timestamped list of transactions sent or received by the account.

On Solscan, you can retrieve details about these tokens.</p> <p dir="ltr">One way to search for a token on Solscan is by simply entering the token’s ticker on the Solscan search bar; however, different tokens can have the same ticker. </p> <p dir="ltr">The safest way to search for a token on Solscan and any other blockchain explorer is using the tokens’ smart contract address. You can obtain the smart contract address of tokens listed on <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/" target="_blank">CoinGecko</a> from the asset's page. For untracked tokens trading on decentralized exchanges, the smart contract address can be obtained from <a href="https://www.geckoterminal.com/" target="_blank">GeckoTerminal</a>. </p> <p dir="ltr">SPL token smart contract addresses look like this: EKpQGSJtjMFqKZ9KQanSqYXRcF8fBopzLHYxdM65zcjm</p> <p dir="ltr">With the token’ address;</p> <ol> <li aria-level="1" dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Visit the <a href="https://solscan.io/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Solscan Platform</a> and enter the token address in the search bar.

Data presented on each featured protocol’s dashboard includes the 24-hour transaction count, daily volume, and Total Value locked (TVL) on the platform. The Solscan DeFi dashboard tracks nine DeFi protocols at the time of writing, including Orca, Raydium, Solend, Zeta, and others.</p> <h3 dir="ltr">NFT Dashboard</h3> <div dir="ltr"><img alt="NFT dashboard Solscan" loading="lazy" src="https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/10203/content_nft_dashboard.webp" style="width: 1200px; height: 582px;"></div> <p dir="ltr">The NFT dashboard shows details of NFT-related activities on the Solana network. It presents real-time data on NFT collections on the network, active NFT trading and collection accounts, volume of NFT trades in 24 hours, and number of NFTs listed on marketplaces on the network. These collections and marketplaces are also ranked according to their prominence on the network.</p> <h3 dir="ltr">Leaderboard</h3> <p dir="ltr"><img alt="Leaderboard Solscan" loading="lazy" src="https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/10204/content_leaderboard.webp" style="width: 1200px; height: 584px;"></p> <p dir="ltr">In the leaderboard section, protocols and assets on the Solana network are ranked according to certain metrics. The token leaderboard ranks assets according to the number of holders, market cap, price (per token), and 24-hour trading volume. Applications are also ranked according to the number of active users and transaction count (including successful transactions). Other network data ranked on the leaderboard includes activity frequency for token accounts.</p> <h2 dir="ltr">Solscan Alternatives</h2> <p dir="ltr">Besides Solscan, there are other available Solana network explorers you can use to explore the Solana blockchain.</p> <h3 dir="ltr">Official Solana Network Explorer</h3> <div dir="ltr"><img alt="Solana Official Network explorer" loading="lazy" src="https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/10205/content_official_explorer.webp" style="width: 1200px; height: 678px;"></div> <p dir="ltr">Like Solscan, the <a href="https://explorer.solana.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">official Solana network explorer</a> allows users to retrieve data on transactions, network accounts, and tokens from the Solana network’s database. The user interface differs significantly from Solscan’s, however, the search functionality is similar. To look up any transaction, enter the transaction hash into the search bar as done on Solscan. You can search for blocks, accounts, transactions, programs, and tokens. </p> <p dir="ltr">However, the official Solana explorer is focused on the core network data, and does not include additional dashboards.</p> <h3 dir="ltr">Solana.Fm</h3> <p dir="ltr"><img alt="Solana.fm" loading="lazy" src="https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/10206/content_solanafm.webp" style="width: 1200px; height: 476px;"></p> <p dir="ltr"><a href="http://solana.fm" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Solana.fm</a> is another alternative to Solscan. Users can browse through Solana network data by querying transactions, user accounts, program data, and tokens. Network details are available on the homepage with a live block update for the Solana network. It features a detailed page for network validators, providing data on the active validators and the number of assets staked under each node, and further details from the Solana network’s staking program. </p> <h2 dir="ltr">Final Thoughts</h2> <p dir="ltr">Solscan lets you run through the Solana blockchain’s database easily. Just like explorers for other blockchain networks and alternative Solana network explorers, anyone using the explorer can obtain almost every data stored on the network without advanced computing procedures. It strengthens the transparency of the network and gives actionable insights beyond transaction and user account queries. Regardless of whether you are simply verifying your wallet balance or carrying out due diligence around a potential investment, Solscan makes it easy for anyone to explore the network. </p> <p dir="ltr">However, note that the effectiveness of blockchain network explorers is highly dependent on users’ ability to use the right queries and utilizing the data presented. This article is only intended as an introduction to the platform, and should not be taken as financial advice. Likewise, projects and accounts mentioned in this article are only for illustrative purposes and should not be considered financial or investment advice. </p> </content>

<title>Create a Crypto Portfolio Dashboard (Python Guide)</title>
<content type="html"><p dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-67b493ab-7fff-fe1e-f4cd-b941ea3d938b">Building a cryptocurrency portfolio dashboard is a great way to start learning more about this emerging financial market. Like any other investment, it is also subject to a certain degree of risk. Therefore, once a portfolio has been created, it becomes important to continuously keep track of its growth. In addition to visualizing trends over time, calculating returns in periodic intervals also helps fine-tune trading strategies and make market entry and exit decisions. </p> <p dir="ltr"><strong>In today's article, we will explore how to build a crypto portfolio dashboard using <a href="https://observablehq.com/framework" target="_blank">Observable Framework</a> and Python.</strong> It will provide a comprehensive breakdown of absolute and relative price change along with clear indicators to calculate returns. Since crypto markets trade 24/7, we will also set up automation using GitHub Actions to update the dashboard regularly.</p> <p dir="ltr">Here’s a <a href="https://vnegi10.github.io/Crypto-return-calculator/value?utm_campaign=learn&amp;utm_content=crypto-portfolio-dashboard-python" target="_blank">live preview</a> of how the dashboard will eventually look like, and you can access the <a href="http://github.com/vnegi10/Crypto-return-calculator?utm_campaign=learn&amp;utm_content=crypto-portfolio-dashboard-python" target="_blank">Github repository</a> here. Let's dive in!</p> <hr> <p dir="ltr"><img alt="How to build a crypto portfolio dashboard python guide - CoinGecko API" src="https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/10271/content_How_to_build_a_crypto_portfolio_dashboard_python_guide_-_CoinGecko_API.webp" style="width: 1200px; height: 597px;"></p> <h2 dir="ltr">Prerequisites</h2> <p dir="ltr">In addition to Python 3, we will need to set up Observable Framework which is a Node.js application. Make sure to install <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download?utm_campaign=learn&amp;utm_content=crypto-portfolio-dashboard-python" target="_blank">Node.js</a> version 18 or later. It’s also recommended to install yarn as the package manager.</p> <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;">npm install --global yarn</span></p> <p dir="ltr">Installed versions of different packages can be verified as shown below:</p> <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;">node --version</span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;">npm --version</span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;">yarn --version</span></p> <p dir="ltr">Since the dashboard will be hosted as a GitHub page, and makes use of GitHub Actions for automation, a personal GitHub account is also needed.</p> <p dir="ltr">The above endpoint can be accessed for free, but requires keyed authentication. All you need to do is sign up and create a Demo account. The key can then be generated using the <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/developers/dashboard?utm_campaign=learn&amp;utm_content=crypto-portfolio-dashboard-python" target="_blank">Developer's Dashboard</a>. In this guide, we will be making use of a Pro API key, which unlocks <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/api/pricing?utm_campaign=learn&amp;utm_content=crypto-portfolio-dashboard-python" target="_blank">higher rate limits</a>.</p> <hr> <h2 dir="ltr">Creating a New Project on Observable Framework</h2> <p dir="ltr">We will begin by creating the folder structure for our dashboard. The frontend takes care of how the dashboard looks like, and will be based on JavaScript. The backend is responsible for fetching the historical price data from CoinGecko, and will make use of Python. To create a new project, run:</p> <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;">yarn create @observablehq</span></p> <p dir="ltr">Now, a series of prompts will appear, which can be answered based on user preferences.  Note that we have selected yarn as the preferred package manager and also initialized a git repository.</p> <p dir="ltr"><img alt="Observable setup process" loading="lazy" src="https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/10184/content_Observable_setup.webp" style="width: 1200px; height: 1026px;"></p> <p dir="ltr">The docs folder will contain code for both the front and backend. In our case, the Python backend will be used to make API calls to CoinGecko and fetch historical price data for a given asset. This is also called a data loader, which will then be used by the dashboard frontend. Within docs, we can create another folder data to store all the Python code. It will further help to organize the code in separate files for better readability as shown in the next sections.</p> <hr> <h2 dir="ltr">How to Fetch Historical Coin Price Data using an API?</h2> <p dir="ltr">In the file<code> api.py</code>, we define the following function to read the API key locally from a file or from an environment variable. The latter is relevant when setting up automation using GitHub Actions, and will be discussed in detail later.</p> <script src="https://gist.github.com/vnegi10/50cddc8d9bddc00d44669512369a6841.js"></script> <div dir="ltr" style="background:#eeeeee;border:1px solid #cccccc;padding:5px 10px;"><em><strong>💡 Pro-tip: </strong>Using a custom exception class such as KeyNotFoundError makes debugging easy.</em></div> <p dir="ltr">We now define another function which will be used to process the API request.

To convert it into the datetime format, we can make use of the following transformation:</p> <script src="https://gist.github.com/vnegi10/8c3a8d5d784537f0f8b6e2995d528233.js"></script> <p>Additionally, we would like to gather price data for all assets, and store it into a list of dictionaries. Such a data structure can be created by initializing with zeros.</p> <script src="https://gist.github.com/vnegi10/82eb280a282b63935affeb99c7ffb115.js"></script> <hr> <h2 dir="ltr">How to Set up Your Crypto Portfolio Dashboard</h2> <p dir="ltr">The pages for the dashboard are grouped into markdown files, where special code blocks can be used to execute JavaScript code. The home page content is specified in the index.md file. Additionally, we will create two more pages with the following idea:</p> <ul> <li aria-level="1" dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr" role="presentation">value.md - Shows change in total value (euros) of the portfolio along with individual breakdowns</p> </li> <li aria-level="1" dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr" role="presentation">change.md - Shows relative change (in %) between different cryptocurrencies with an interactive date selection feature</p> </li> </ul> <p dir="ltr">Similar to our Python backend, we can also organize the front end code in separate files to enable reuse and enhance readability. The plotting functions are grouped in the components/plots.js file. For the first page, we want to make a line + area plot to track total value change in our portfolio. This can be achieved using the fantastic <a href="https://observablehq.com/plot/">Observable Plot</a> library.</p> <script src="https://gist.github.com/vnegi10/2a16f4044cbc2f2917fadcf091bef11f.js"></script> <p><img alt="Area plot of total portfolio value" loading="lazy" src="https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/10185/content_Total_value.webp" style="width: 1200px; height: 578px;"></p> <p>Similarly, it helps to also visualize changes in the individual assets within the portfolio since there can be a situation where some of them stay the same or decrease in value over time. A stacked bar plot is therefore a neat way to gain more insights into the performance of the individual assets.</p> <script src="https://gist.github.com/vnegi10/2a369504b1693916f80f645c58256611.js"></script> <p><img alt="Stacked bar plot" loading="lazy" src="https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/10186/content_Stacked_bar.webp" style="width: 1200px; height: 626px;"></p> <p>A stacked area plot shows the same information, but can be more visually appealing.</p> <script src="https://gist.github.com/vnegi10/f1b4b171dfdf53e0d65533daea62edb4.js"></script> <p><img alt="Stacked area plot" loading="lazy" src="https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/10187/content_Stacked_area.webp" style="width: 1200px; height: 576px;"></p> <p>To give the user better perspective on the magnitude of the portfolio changes, we can also add two cards on the top row, one displaying the % change over last 7 days, while the other for last 30 days.</p> <p dir="ltr"><img alt="Change cards" loading="lazy" src="https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/10188/content_Change_cards.webp" style="width: 1200px; height: 183px;"></p> <p dir="ltr">The % change can be easily calculated by making a JavaScript function getPertChange which takes the number of days as an additional input.</p> <script src="https://gist.github.com/vnegi10/0081084361d09e5044928c00db8dcbae.js"></script> <p>Overall layout of the page is controlled via the following code in value.md:</p> <script src="https://gist.github.com/vnegi10/5cc6144e6659a98627637cf921d09369.js"></script> <p>The second page (change.md) shows relative performance when comparing all the assets in the portfolio. </p> <script src="https://gist.github.com/vnegi10/4f0d90d3431fc33e413219dfc11fab1f.js"></script> <p dir="ltr"><img alt="Change in individual value of portfolio components" loading="lazy" src="https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/10189/content_Change_individual_value.webp" style="width: 1200px; height: 577px;"></p> <p dir="ltr">A similar approach can be taken to show the change in total value.</p> <script src="https://gist.github.com/vnegi10/fb2c8b7033133ea8b08b7444d827e7df.js"></script> <p dir="ltr"><img alt="Change in total portfolio value for selected date range" loading="lazy" src="https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/10190/content_Change_total_value.webp" style="width: 1200px; height: 580px;"></p> <p dir="ltr">Similar to the first page, it will be useful to add two cards on the top, which shows the top performer (maximum % change in value) over a period of 7 and 30 days. </p> <p dir="ltr"><img alt="Top performer for a given duration" loading="lazy" src="https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/10191/content_Top_performer.webp" style="width: 1200px; height: 185px;">To calculate the top performer, we make use of the following logic:</p> <script src="https://gist.github.com/vnegi10/18b54b41dd0e2fc4524370d447ee622c.js"></script> <p dir="ltr">Additionally, we would like to have an interactive date selection feature, so that we can have different points of origin when comparing the relative performance. This is achieved using the Date interface component available via <a href="https://observablehq.com/documentation/inputs/overview#date?utm_campaign=learn&amp;utm_content=crypto-portfolio-dashboard-python" target="_blank">Observable Inputs</a>.</p> <table> <colgroup> </colgroup> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;">const date = view(<br>     Inputs.date({<br>         label: "Select starting date for comparison",<br>         min: clubbedStack[0].time,<br>         max: clubbedStack[clubbedStack.length - 1].time<br>         }));</span></p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p><img alt="Select date" loading="lazy" src="https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/10274/content_Screenshot_2024-05-20_at_7.37.11%E2%80%AFPM.webp" style="width: 1200px; height: 605px;"></p> <p>The overall page layout is controlled via the following logic:</p> <script src="https://gist.github.com/vnegi10/2cd72e9c117c787d612c4db4c4b80e0b.js"></script> <hr> <h2 dir="ltr">How to Test the Dashboard Locally?</h2> <p dir="ltr">Once both the front and backend code is ready, the dashboard can be built locally to verify that everything works as expected. Observable Framework supports live preview, which means that the in-browser page updates automatically whenever any changes are made. This helps to quickly test the impact of any changes made to the page layout or to the data loaders.</p> <p dir="ltr">To start the preview server, execute the following:</p> <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;">yarn dev</span></p> <p dir="ltr">A browser window should open automatically. If not, then visit the following address: <a href="http://127.0.0.1:3000/" target="_blank">http://127.0.0.1:3000/</a></p> <hr> <h2>How to Deploy the Dashboard to GitHub Pages?</h2> <p>In the previous section, we managed to generate the dashboard locally.</p> <p>As you might also want to check on your portfolio when away from your laptop, or on your mobile phone, we will now take a step further and make use of GitHub Actions to automatically deploy our dashboard to our very own GitHub Page – this will make it accessible across all devices.</p> <p>We can even set a schedule at which the dashboard should be updated, which ensures that the impact of any sudden price movement becomes immediately visible to us.</p> <p dir="ltr">The Observable project was initialized as a Git repository in the beginning. This can now be pushed to GitHub, as is also done for the <a href="https://github.com/vnegi10/Crypto-return-calculator" target="_blank">code in this article</a>. Now we need to enable deployment for Pages. Navigate to <strong>Settings </strong>&gt; <strong>Pages</strong> &gt; <strong>Build and Deployment</strong> &gt;<strong> Source </strong>(select <strong>GitHub Actions</strong>).</p> <p dir="ltr">The CoinGecko API key should be saved as a repository secret: <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Secrets and variables</strong> &gt;<strong> Actions</strong> &gt; <strong>Secrets</strong> &gt; <strong>Repository secrets</strong> &gt; <strong>New repository secret.</strong></p> <p dir="ltr">The next step is to create a workflow file that will be used to build and deploy the dashboard. The file contains one or more jobs, which are essentially a sequence of steps describing how we want to create the software environment and build the dashboard. We need to ensure that all dependencies (Node.js and Python) are installed first during the build job. The last step uploads artifacts, which are picked up by the deploy job, which details how the pages should be created.</p> <script src="https://gist.github.com/vnegi10/a26291fee1005b794dd75a4ba8cb24da.js"></script> <p dir="ltr">The schedule trigger can be used to set a predefined frequency with which the dashboard will be built and deployed. It makes use of the <a href="https://crontab.guru/" target="_blank">cron syntax</a>, which can be adapted as per your need. The example above triggers the workflow 30 minutes past an hour, every two hours (02:30, 04:30 etc). Summary of the workflow runs appears in the Actions tab.</p> <p dir="ltr"><img alt="Summary of GitHub Actions workflow runs" loading="lazy" src="https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/10192/content_Actions_summary.webp" style="width: 1200px; height: 653px;"></p> <p dir="ltr">Opening a single workflow result shows a figure with all connected jobs (only two in our case). The URL of the deployed GitHub page is also visible.</p> <p dir="ltr"><img alt="Summary of a selected Actions workflow" loading="lazy" src="https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/10193/content_Workflow_summary.webp" style="width: 1200px; height: 456px;"></p> <div dir="ltr" style="background:#eeeeee;border:1px solid #cccccc;padding:5px 10px;"><em><strong>💡 Pro-tip: </strong>By default, GitHub pages will be visible to everyone.

<title>What Is Ethena, ENA, and Its Synthetic Dollar USDe</title>
<content type="html"><h2 dir="ltr">What Is Ethena? </h2> <p dir="ltr">Ethena is the project behind USDe, a synthetic dollar backed by assets including ETH, stETH, BTC, and USDT. USDe does not rely on traditional financial infrastructure, nor does it require overcollateralization.</p> <hr> <h3 dir="ltr">Key Takeaways</h3> <ul> <li aria-level="1" dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr" role="presentation">The supply of USDe has grown past $2.3 billion at the time of writing.</p> </li> <li aria-level="1" dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Ethena uses a delta-hedging mechanism to manage the risk associated with the fluctuation in the value of the backing assets. This is done via a relative short position created against the backing assets in a derivatives exchange.</p> </li> <li aria-level="1" dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr" role="presentation">USDe can be spent like any other digital asset and users accrues value through protocol yield by staking idle USDe with Ethena. </p> </li> <li aria-level="1" dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr" role="presentation">ENA, the native token of Ethena, is used for governance and can also be locked for rewards on selected platforms.</p> </li> <li aria-level="1" dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr" role="presentation">This article explains how USDe and Ethena protocol works to create a form of money bonded to the internet.</p> </li> </ul> <hr> <div dir="ltr"><img alt="What is Ethena, ENA and USDe" src="https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/10238/content_What_is_Ethena__ENA_and_USDe.webp" style="width: 1200px; height: 600px;"></div> <p dir="ltr"><em>This article is brought to you by Ethena.</em></p> <p dir="ltr">One of the biggest challenges facing the crypto space is the lack of a crypto-native solution for a globally accessible dollar denominated financial instrument that doesn’t rely on traditional banking infrastructure. Currently, crypto assets referencing the US dollar play a vital role in the operation of the crypto space, as they offer users a way to preserve their capital, removed from the volatility of cryptocurrencies.</p> <p dir="ltr">Centralized stablecoins like USDC and USDT are stable and scalable, but they have a heavy reliance on traditional financial infrastructure and custodial risk. Likewise, <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/learn/what-are-decentralized-stablecoins" target="_blank">decentralized stablecoins</a> that don’t rely on traditional financial infrastructure face issues like scalability and instability around mechanism design. </p> <p dir="ltr">Ethena believes that the crypto space could benefit greatly from a form of money bonded to the sector, developed with practices that correspond to its principles. Toward this goal, it is building strategies and technologies to bolster USDe, a synthetic dollar built around crypto. </p> <p dir="ltr">Over $400 million worth of USDe was minted within the first week of public launch and this has grown by over $1.8 billion just about 8 weeks later. At the time of writing, the supply of <a href="https://app.ethena.fi/dashboards/solvency" target="_blank">USDe sits at $2.37 billion</a> as the industry’s’ interest in the project grows.</p> <h2 dir="ltr">Introducing Ethena</h2> <p dir="ltr">Ethena is a protocol built for the minting, redemption, and staking of USDe. It is designed to oversee key operations like minting, redeeming, collateral and risk management, staking, and other aspects of USDe. Ethena consists of smart contracts, position management algorithms, and off-protocol operations that work in synergy to ensure that the USDe functions as expected. Ethena enables the minting and redemption of USDe through a smart contract-controlled processes.</p> <p dir="ltr">According to the project, Ethena aims to develop a crypto-native financial solution by creating a synthetic asset that intends to closely mirror the value of the US dollar. While USDe is not a stablecoin like USDT or DAI, it’s intended that the price of USDe remains around one US dollar.</p> <p dir="ltr">Ethena does this by constructing a position that has the aggregate value of a dollar on a relatively consistent and mostly predictable basis. To protect USDe from risks associated in the value of underlying assets,  Ethena opens a short position on the collateral asset on derivatives exchanges (in the same notional amount of spot backing held). This is expected to keep USDe relatively stable, even in extreme market conditions.</p> <h2 dir="ltr">What Is USDe?</h2> <p dir="ltr">USDe has seen impressive growth since its public launch, reaching a supply of $400 million within the first week and climbing to over $2 billion barely two months later.</p> <div dir="ltr"><img alt="USDe Supply" loading="lazy" src="https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/10207/content_USDe_Supply.webp" style="width: 1056px; height: 586px;"></div> <p dir="ltr">USDe can be minted by whitelisted participants using any of the supported <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/learn/crypto-collateral-defi" target="_blank">collateral</a> assets, which as of this writing includes USDT, ETH, and liquid staked Ether (stETH), as well as the recent<a href="https://twitter.com/ethena_labs/status/1775944410011926931" target="_blank"> addition of BTC</a>. Since integration, BTC has become a significant component of USDe’s backing, accounting for<a href="https://app.ethena.fi/dashboards/positions" target="_blank"> about 35% of the pool’s value</a> at the time of writing:</p> <div dir="ltr"><img alt="USDe Collateral" loading="lazy" src="https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/10208/content_USDe_Collateral.webp" style="width: 1200px; height: 333px;"></div> <p dir="ltr">USDe can be traded against other crypto assets on supported centralized and decentralized exchanges, used to obtain loans on lending protocols that have integrated it, or any other purposes via integrations by supporting protocols and platforms. By way of example, MakerDAO announced  the integration of USDe into the Spark platform, whereby users can deposit USDe to borrow <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/dai" target="_blank">DAI</a> through Spark based on the breakdown <a href="https://twitter.com/MakerDAO/status/1777333223732736430" target="_blank">here</a>. </p> <h2 dir="ltr">How USDe Maintains Its Value</h2> <p dir="ltr">USDe is not overcollateralized by minter assets, and whitelisted users can mint an amount of USDe equal to the value of the backing provided minus operational costs. </p> <p dir="ltr">As a synthetic dollar backed by assets whose value fluctuates, Ethena Protocol protects the backing of USDe from market price fluctuation via delta-hedging. This strategy involves taking offsetting positions in derivatives markets to neutralize the price movements of the USDe’s backing assets. When USDe is minted, an equivalent short position is opened on a derivatives exchange such that any loss in the value of the backing asset is generally balanced by gains from the short position, and vice versa. </p> <p dir="ltr">The protocol incorporates ‘Off-Exchange Settlement’ providers to handle the asset availability for the minting, redemption, and hedging process. When USDe is minted, the protocol transfers the provided backing assets to the Off-Exchange Settlement solution wallet and instructs the Off-Exchange Settlement provider to delegate funds to a derivatives exchange. The solution is used to open an offsetting short position and to ensure no backing asset is ever exposed to centralized exchange counterparty risks.</p> <p dir="ltr">A reverse procedure is followed when USDe is redeemed. A corresponding short position is closed as the protocol sends the backing asset to the redeeming wallet, and USDe holders will burn USDe in exchange for backing assets of equal value.</p> <p dir="ltr">According to Ethena, using an off-exchange settlement provider protects the system from risks associated with centralized exchanges and allows easy auditing of the asset managed by the protocol. </p> <p dir="ltr">Ethena also provides a share of the protocol yield to stakers of USDe. At the time of writing, sUSDe APY is 10.8%. According to the project, the protocol’s yield is generated via</p> <ul> <li aria-level="1" dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Ethereum staking reward which is around 4% and could go as high as 6%.</p> </li> <li aria-level="1" dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Proceeds from the funding and basis spread earned from delta hedging derivatives positions.</p> </li> </ul> <p dir="ltr">Ethereum staking rewards are generated from the consensus and execution layer rewards from Ether staked to the Ethereum PoS network and liquid staked Ether (stETH). Staking rewards could vary in response to network conditions. The proceeds from the funding and basis spread of delta hedging derivatives positions depends on the funding rate of the derivative position. The APY received by stakers is expected to vary according to changes in the yield sources and market dynamics.</p> <h2 dir="ltr">USDe vs. UST</h2> <p dir="ltr">USDe has drawn interest amongst crypto investors and analysts. The relatively high APY of the protocol partly influenced its supply swell, but the protocol has also drawn comparison with Terra’s failed algorithmic stablecoin UST. UST previously promised that its holders would earn 20% annualized yield by depositing with its sister protocol Anchor.</p> <p dir="ltr">UST was unbacked, holding its dollar peg through arbitrage with another Terra token – LUNA. However, this meant that when users dumped the LUNA token, it resulted in a death spiral as the value plummeted. </p> <p dir="ltr">Unlike UST, USDe is backed at a 1:1 rate, utilizing short BTC and ETH futures positions to offset any changes in value in the underlying backing assets. This improves the capital efficiency of USDe when compared against onchain collateralized stablecoins like DAI, which require minimum collateral ratios of 150%, and is a crucial fundamental difference from UST.</p> <p dir="ltr">As compared to Anchor – whose yield sources were somewhat opaque - Ethena generates protocol yield from staked ETH and the basis from perpetual short positions. In the case of funding rates, traders will either pay or receive funding based on the difference between spot prices and perpetual contract markets. Historically, perpetual funding rates are positive, whereby long positions pay shorts.</p> <div dir="ltr"><img alt="Excess Yield Ethena" loading="lazy" src="https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/10209/content_Excess_Yield_Ethena.webp" style="width: 1200px; height: 804px;"></div> <h2 dir="ltr">Benefits of USDe</h2> <p dir="ltr">USDe is emerging as an alternative to traditional stablecoins, offering users a relatively stable asset to compose throughout the ecosystem, along with potential protocol-level yield that partially accrues to a dollar denominated means of preserving capital. Here are some of the benefits of USDe. </p> <h3 dir="ltr">Accruing Protocol Yield With sUSDe</h3> <p dir="ltr">sUSDe represents a proportional amount of the total USDe locked in Ethena protocol’s staking pool. Stakers might notice the difference in the amount of USDe locked and the sUSDe received, The ratio difference represents the value of sUSDe as more USDe is transferred to the pool by the protocol. When unstaking, the staker receives its proportional amount of USDe based on the total amount of USDe in the pool. Accrual to sUSDe from protocol yield varies, but has stayed above 10% annualized since launch, offering one of the highest dollar-denominated value accruals in the space.</p> <h3 dir="ltr">Scalability</h3> <p dir="ltr">USDe is designed to meet market demands. The protocol’s capacity responds to the demand for the USDe and relies on the capacity via open interest to place hedged positions.. With the integration of BTC, the protocol will be able to scale over 2.5 times its current capacity, as BTC open interest on major exchanges sits at $20bn. In a similar sense, whitelisted addresses can mint and redeem USDe according to their needs. USDe’s flexible model makes it easier to scale in and out. Non-whitelisted users can dispose of USDe via Curve pools and other DEXs.</p> <h3 dir="ltr">Censorship resistance</h3> <p dir="ltr">Key aspects of USDe’s operations are not tied to any traditional financial institution. The assets used as backing are crypto assets and are not held by institutions like banks. Instead, the assets are spread across multiple platforms that specialize in institutional crypto asset management in bankruptcy-remote solutions. This creates a financial system that is less susceptible to external factors. </p> <h2 dir="ltr">Risks of USDe</h2> <p dir="ltr">As a synthetic dollar, USDe relies on an interplay between factors related to the protocol itself, the collateral assets, and external facilities that power the protocol. However, this also means that USDe has different potential <a href="https://ethena-labs.gitbook.io/ethena-labs/solution-overview/risks" target="_blank">risks</a> from fiat stablecoins. </p> <h3 dir="ltr">Funding Risk</h3> <p dir="ltr">The funding rate of the short position is a primary source of Ethena’s yield. As long as the funding rate stays positive, the protocol earns from the position. While this has stayed positive, the possibility of going negative is still present. When the funding rate is negative, the protocol not only stops earning from the position but also needs to commit funds to the position. According to Ethena, this is usually short-lived and in this case, the protocol has set aside a reserve fund for this purpose, which sits at over $37m today. Also, the protocol states that “Ethena does not pass on any ‘negative yield’ to users who stake their USDe for sUSDe.”</p> <h3 dir="ltr">Collateral Risk</h3> <p dir="ltr">While Ethena Protocol accepts liquid staked Ether (stETH) as collateral and uses it as collateral for some short positions, normal ETH is also used as collateral for the Ethereum short position. The collateral risk emerges due to the discrepancy between normal ETH and liquid staked Ether as there is a possibility of stETH losing its ETH peg. According to it, it protects the protocol from this risk via low leverage and rigid collateral practices. LST collateral only makes up roughly 10% of USDe backing assets today, so the risk is minimized.</p> <p dir="ltr">Some other risks associated with USDe include custodial and exchange failure. In the case of the former, Ethena depends on ‘Off-Exchange Settlement’ provider solutions to hold protocol backing assets. The latter is related to issues with the operation of the derivative platform where the protocol’s delta-hedging operation takes place. However, to minimize exposure to exchange failures, protocol backing is never deposited to exchanges.</p> <h2 dir="ltr">What Is ENA?</h2> <p dir="ltr">Ethena airdropped 5% of<a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethena" target="_blank"> ENA</a>, its native token, to early ecosystem contributors and participants of the Shards campaign as part of its community development goals. The Shards campaign focused on increasing liquidity within the ecosystem and aligning incentives with early adopters, including pools on different DeFi platforms like Curve and <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/learn/pendle" target="_blank">Pendle Finance</a>.</p> <p dir="ltr">Through the ENA token, the project hopes to create an economy to support the operations of the Ethena protocol. The total supply of ENA is set to 15 billion; about 1.42 billion tokens have gone into circulation after the TGE event. Part of the supply will be vested according to the project's vesting agreements. The 5% airdrop distribution is part of the 30% allocated to ecosystem development. Other allocations include 15% to the Ethena Foundation, 20% to investors, and 30% to core contributors. </p> <p dir="ltr">ENA will be used in endeavors related to the project including; general risk management frameworks, community grants, and growing the reserve fund. It will also be used for funding project developments. ENA is tradable on top-tier centralized exchanges like Binance, Kucoin and Bybit and also on decentralized exchanges like Uniswap. <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethena" target="_blank">See active trading pairs for ENA</a>.</p> <p dir="ltr">The <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/learn/what-is-fully-diluted-valuation-fdv-in-crypto" target="_blank">FDV (fully diluted valuation)</a> of ENA is $11.7 bn, which is more than four times that of Maker’s MKR ($2.6 bn). </p> <p dir="ltr">Following the success of the Shards campaign, Ethena also announced the <a href="https://mirror.xyz/0xF99d0E4E3435cc9C9868D1C6274DfaB3e2721341/GTbzFynrve4gzSjIEKL0vz7Kq0UHkIiekHkup0EXgjU" target="_blank">Sats campaign</a> after integrating BTC as a backing asset. The Sats campaign requires participants to participate in Ethena-related pools on certain platforms. The Sats campaign will last for 5 months or until USDe supply reaches $5 billion. Users can take part in the Sats campaign at <a href="https://app.ethena.fi/join" target="_blank">https://app.ethena.fi/join</a>. </p> <h2 dir="ltr">USDe Integration with Bybit</h2> <p dir="ltr">Prior to this partnership, other dollar assets such as USDT have dominated perpetual future pairs as the primary collateral asset in the industry, but without passing any value accrual to their holders with issuers internalizing all benefits from being utilized as margin collateral. In fact, there is currently  &gt;$20bn of USD-pegged collateral being used to margin perpetuals which is capturing no yield for the holder.</p> <p dir="ltr">Thanks to this integration, Bybit users will now be able to potentially accrue value on their USDe collateral margining perpetual futures through Bybit. Receiving a yield on the collateral asset will unlock greater capital efficiency for users by enabling them to offset funding costs, via simply holding the collateral margining the position. This type of capital efficiency is a first in crypto history</p> <p dir="ltr">In addition to the integration described above, USDe held on Bybit - whether held in the user’s account unutilized or used as margin collateral - will receive 20x sats per USDe on top of potential yield from Bybit. There will also be spot BTC and ETH - USDe pairs, as well as USDe integration with Bybit’s Earn products.</p> <h2 dir="ltr">Final Thoughts</h2> <p dir="ltr">Ethena’s vision can be summarized as an attempt to create ‘crypto money’ – one that works for the sector, with tools created by the sector. Everything about the project is focused on crypto, from the supported collateral assets to the redemption and yield system, with the goal of providing all users with a dollar denominated means of capital preservation that is scalable, stable, and censorship-resistant. </p> <p dir="ltr">However, despite the potential it holds, it is important to understand the risks associated with systems like this as outlined above. Users should always do their own research before investing and interacting with any protocol.

<title>What Is GME? A GameStop Tribute Meme Coin on Solana</title>
<content type="html"><p><meta charset="utf-8"></p> <h2 dir="ltr">Why Is GME Rising?</h2> <p dir="ltr">The GME meme coin is a tribute to the GameStop meme stock saga, and because of a new tweet from Roaring Kitty – one of the main characters in the initial GameStop meme stock surge. The GME meme coin is riding on the wave of renewed interest in GameStop, rising in value by over 30 times.</p> <hr> <h3 dir="ltr">Key Takeaways</h3> <ul> <li aria-level="1" dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr" role="presentation">GME is a meme coin on the Solana network based on the popular GameStop meme stock that uses the same ticker (GME).</p> </li> <li aria-level="1" dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr" role="presentation">The GME/SOL pair was created on January 28, 2024 in a fair launch.</p> </li> <li aria-level="1" dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr" role="presentation">GME memecoin skyrocketed to a market cap of over $120 million following a post on X signaling the return of Roaring Kitty – the YouTube content creator famous for his role in the 2021 whirlwind involving the GameStop stock.</p> </li> </ul> <hr> <div dir="ltr"><img alt="What is GME solana crypto" src="https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/10243/content_What_is_GME_solana_crypto.webp" style="width: 1200px; height: 600px;"></div> <p dir="ltr">Keith Gill (aka <a href="https://twitter.com/TheRoaringKitty" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Roaring Kitty on X</a>)  led one of the most interesting events on Wall Street in 2021, causing a rally in the market price of GME, the Nasdaq-listed stock of gaming equipment company, GameStop. The short squeeze story and everything that came with it was championed by the ‘cult’ Keith unintentionally created with the intent to go against the traditional finance institution that runs Wall Street. The Reddit group r/wallstreetbets housed the millions of ‘degenerates’ that contributed to this story.</p> <p dir="ltr">While the GME story might never fade away, the price of the stock had been settling until Roaring Kitty tweeted for the first time since June 19 2021. </p> <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"> <p dir="ltr" lang="zxx"><a href="https://t.co/YgjVqtgcNS">pic.twitter.com/YgjVqtgcNS</a></p> — Roaring Kitty (@TheRoaringKitty) <a href="https://twitter.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1789807772542067105?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 13, 2024</a> </blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> <p dir="ltr">This led to a rise of interest in GameStop stocks, which in turn led to the spike of interest in the GME meme coin. </p> <h2 dir="ltr">What Is GME (GameStop)?</h2> <p dir="ltr">GME is a Solana meme coin created as a tribute to the popular GameStop meme stock event in 2021 based on information from GeckoTerminal. Like any other meme coin, GME was created without any intent of blue-chip utilities. </p> <p dir="ltr">The theme? To replicate the events of January 2021 – rebelling against the financial titans and creating value solely with the power of the community; also to grow the value of the GME meme coin beyond the market cap of the GameStop stock. </p> <p dir="ltr">Like most meme coins, GME has a low-entry barrier. Users don’t need to do extensive investment research, and just have to buy into the coin because it has a fun community. GME adopts the slogan ‘we love the coin’ a pluralized form of the phrase used first by Keith Gill and popularized by the ‘degenerates’ who championed the GameStop fiasco.</p> <div dir="ltr"><span style="font-size:11px;"><img alt="GME I like the coin" loading="lazy" src="https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/10240/content_GH2ePFvWIAAy1sw.webp" style="width: 874px; height: 725px;"></span></div> <div dir="ltr"><span style="font-size:11px;">Source: <a href="https://twitter.com/gmecoinsol" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">GME on X</a></span></div> <p dir="ltr">GME draws its popularity from the original GameStop story and the community members that have shown support for the meme coin across social media channels and other media. The GameStop meme coin community has grown to thousands of followers on social media and on the project’s Telegram community. </p> <p dir="ltr">GME has seen significant success in the goal of community-building, another important contributor to its popularity is the memecoin boom sustained on the Solana network.</p> <p dir="ltr">Do note that the GME meme coin has no ties to the actual GameStop stock. </p> <h2 dir="ltr">GME’s Rise in Popularity</h2> <p dir="ltr">GME’s value grew over 30 times since May 13, following the presumed return to social media of Keith Gill, the leading figure in the GameStop Stock story. The post on his X account under his popular pseudonym – Roaring Kitty – has been viewed by over 25 million people at the time of writing and sparked a frenzy in the meme coin space and on Wall Street, with the meme stock reaching new heights for the first time since late 2021.</p> <p dir="ltr"><img alt="GME Stock Price" loading="lazy" src="https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/10241/content_GME_Stock_Price.webp" style="width: 1174px; height: 729px;"></p> <p dir="ltr">Like its namesake, GME’s price has skyrocketed to new heights since May 13 2024. GME’s market cap rose to over $100 million from levels below $4 million on May 11 2024, with token prices rising from $0.00049 to $0.019 at time of writing.</p> <p dir="ltr"><img alt="GME Token Price" loading="lazy" src="https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/10242/content_GME_token_price.webp" style="width: 1200px; height: 737px;"></p> <p dir="ltr">This event trickled down to other memecoins with a reference to Keith Gill, GameStop, and Wall Street, such as AMC, and a handful of Wolverine-themed tokens. But the GameStop meme coin story had begun even before this event. </p> <h2 dir="ltr">History of GME</h2> <p dir="ltr">The <a href="https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/pools/9tz6vYKiBDLYx2RnGWC5tESu4pyVE4jD6Tm56352UGte" target="_blank">GME/SOL pair</a> was created on Raydium on January 28, 2024, as a fair launch on the Raydium DEX on the anniversary of the GameStop story. This follows the release of ‘Dumb Money’; a Netflix movie based on this story about a week earlier.  According to the <a href="https://wallstsucks.lol/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">official website</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p dir="ltr">“This isn't just a cryptocurrency; it's a movement, a display of the digital community and the power of the underdog. Born on the Solana blockchain, known for its lightning-fast transactions and pioneering spirit, the $GME Memecoin embodies the essence of that historic rebellion against financial titans, channeling the raw energy and incredible support that defined the GameStop mania”</p> </blockquote> <p dir="ltr">The community grew with a horde of crypto influencers joining the movement echoing the slogan ‘We love the coin’. Social media ‘raids’ formed the bulk of the marketing efforts with different pictures decorated with the red headband popularly worn by Keith Gill during his YouTube streams, and ‘the Headband Stays on’ slogan. The headband photos can be generated on the project’s website. </p> <p dir="ltr"><img alt="GME headbands" loading="lazy" src="https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/10239/content_Screenshot_%282138%29.webp" style="width: 732px; height: 732px;"></p> <p dir="ltr">The GME meme coin reached over 15,000 holders within the first week of launch. On March 2, 2024, it crossed the 20,000 holders count for the first time.</p> <p dir="ltr">Following a long consolidation, the GME meme coin market cap went into a steady decline reaching a market cap of $2.5 million on April 30, 2024, until Keith Gill’s return to social media and the investment space on May 13 2024. Other meme coins based on the GameStop and Keith Gill story include a cat-themed memecoin that references the popular YouTuber.</p> <h2 dir="ltr">GME Tokenomics</h2> <p dir="ltr">About 6.9 billion <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/gme" target="_blank">GME tokens</a> are currently in circulation. The total supply is unknown, however, this asset appears to have no extra mint functions. GME tokens are mainly used for trading, with no additional utility at time of writing. GME currently has a 24 hour trading volume of $147,644,110 and a market cap of over $134 million. </p> <p dir="ltr">Gamestop (GME) trades on centralized and decentralized exchanges with the GME ticker, note that several copies could exist, so always verify the token address before committing any funds. Active trading platforms for GME include centralized exchanges like Coinex, Bitget, and BingX, and decentralized exchanges on the Solana network including Orca and Jupiter. <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/gme" target="_blank">See active trading pairs for GME memecoin</a>.</p> <h2 dir="ltr"> Final Thoughts</h2> <p dir="ltr">GME draws its popularity and inspiration from the GameStop meme stock story, although it doesn’t have any ties to the GameStop stock. Like other meme coins, GME is built on its community. However, meme coins are prone to high volatility, and potential investors should be aware of the risks associated with trading cryptocurrencies.

Since this time, <a href="https://defillama.com/chain/Blast" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">over $1 billion worth of crypto assets has been locked</a> on decentralized applications in its ecosystem according to data from DefiLlama, with an average of <a href="https://app.artemis.xyz/chains" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">70,000 unique addresses using this network daily</a>. </p> <div dir="ltr"><img alt="Transactions on Blast" loading="lazy" src="https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/10217/content_Transactions_on_Blast.webp" style="width: 1200px; height: 641px;"></div> <p dir="ltr">HMX – a decentralized perpetual trading platform – joins the list of notable DeFi applications in the Blast ecosystem and is playing a role in onboarding the next set of users to the network.</p> <p dir="ltr">Here we review the platform and its upcoming Golden Slam campaign on Blast.</p> <h2 dir="ltr">What Is HMX?</h2> <p dir="ltr">HMX is a multichain decentralized perpetual contract trading platform that offers traders up to 1000X leverage on perpetual contracts of supported asset pairs, and was first launched on Arbitrum and has since expanded to the Blast L2 network. It employs novel technologies like <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/learn/account-abstraction-crypto" target="_blank">account abstraction</a> and existing decentralized financial protocols to handle routine derivative trading activities like making trade orders, collateral custody, liquidity provision, and liquidation for bad trades.</p> <p dir="ltr">According to <a href="https://dune.com/hmxintern/hmx-analytics" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">data</a> from the project, HMX has processed over $30 billion worth of perpetual contract trades and has generated about $12 million dollars in trading fees. </p> <div dir="ltr"><img alt="Trading Volume HMX" loading="lazy" src="https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/10218/content_Trading_Volume_HMX.webp" style="width: 1175px; height: 602px;"></div> <p dir="ltr">The <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/hmx" target="_blank">HMX</a> token powers the HMX trading platform. It doubles as the utility and <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/learn/governance-tokens" target="_blank">governance</a> token of the project. HMX holders gain exclusive privileges in the form of passive income and platform fee discounts when they stake their HMX tokens, and they can also vote on platform improvements via the HMX DAO. At the time of writing, HMX tokens can be traded on Gate exchange and decentralized trading platforms on the Arbitrum and Blast networks. <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/hmx" target="_blank">See active trading pairs for HMX</a>.</p> <p dir="ltr">Now, let’s look at how HMX users can benefit actively from routine leveraged trading and passively by providing <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/learn/liquidity-crypto" target="_blank">liquidity</a>.</p> <h3 dir="ltr">Leveraged Trading</h3> <p dir="ltr">Trading with leverage is a way to maximize profits from a winning trade. HMX offers up to 1000X leverage, where traders can boost their profits based on the selected leverage multiplier. Do note, however, that increasing leverage also increases the potential loss in the event of bad trades.</p> <h3 dir="ltr">Leveraged Market Making</h3> <p dir="ltr">Market makers on HMX are liquidity providers who commit their assets to the HLP vault. The HLP vault is built on GMX, allowing traders on HMX to benefit from the <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/learn/liquidity-pools-crypto-defi" target="_blank">liquidity pool</a> on GMX and also allows liquidity providers on GMX and HMX to benefit from revenue generated on both platforms. The HLP vault supports GMX-ETH, GMX-BTC, and bridged USDC (USDC.e) on Arbitrum and ETH and Rebased USDC on Blast network. GMX users who provide BTC and ETH liquidity can stake their GMX LP tokens on HMX and enjoy the benefits that HMX offers in addition to 100% of the liquidity provider benefits on GMX.</p> <p dir="ltr">Liquidity Providers on HMX are entitled to 50% of the protocol’s revenue (this is paid in USDC.e), 100% of the revenue generated from counter trading, and esHMX (Escrowed HMX) rewards based on the size of their GM deposits &amp; emission rates. At time of writing, the HLP vault holds over $29 million worth of crypto assets.</p> <p dir="ltr">HMX is running a series of promotional activities to boost usage on the new Blast network. Following the completion of the trading competition where the project distributed 6,000 Blast Gold to participants, it has announced a sequel – the Golden Slam campaign.</p> <h2 dir="ltr">HMX Golden Slam Campaign</h2> <p dir="ltr">Blast is attracting new users to its network. One way it has done this so far is through the distribution of Blast Gold to active projects on the platform. Blast Gold Points are more valuable than regular Blast Points, and are designed to grow projects on Blast by incentivizing users to utilize the dApps. </p> <div dir="ltr"><img alt="Blast Gold" loading="lazy" src="https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/10219/content_Blast_Gold.webp" style="width: 1200px; height: 678px;"></div> <p dir="ltr">HMX is releasing Blast Gold to its Blast network users; first with the recently concluded trading competition, and now with the new Golden Slam campaign.</p> <p dir="ltr">As part of the Golden Slam campaign, HMX has announced a prize pool of 8,000 Blast Gold. According to the project, Blast Gold’s speculated value sits at $15, bringing the total prize budget for the Golden Slam campaign to about $120,000 to be distributed to traders and liquidity providers on the platform.</p> <p dir="ltr">You can view your Golden Slam Dashboard under the Golden Slam tab on HMX.</p> <div dir="ltr"><img alt="Golden Slam Dashboard" loading="lazy" src="https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/10220/content_Golden_Slam_Dashboard.webp" style="width: 1200px; height: 838px;"></div> <div dir="ltr"> </div> <h3 dir="ltr">HMX Golden Slam Campaign for Traders</h3> <p dir="ltr">The Golden Slam campaign will consist of several draws conducted on an hourly basis, where each hour is known as an epoch.  Traders earn points for every dollar traded on HMX on Blast, where the number of points received will be based on the asset class traded. For every 1,000 points accrued, you will receive a Gold Pass.</p> <p dir="ltr">Here’s the point allocation per dollar trade value and the volume required for a Gold Pass for each supported asset;</p> <div dir="ltr"><img alt="Golden Slam Trading Table" loading="lazy" src="https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/10221/content_Golden_Slam_Trading_Table.webp" style="width: 1200px; height: 611px;"></div> <p dir="ltr">At the end of each epoch, the traders’ accrued points are reset to zero. </p> <h3 dir="ltr">HMX Golden Slam Campaign for HLP Depositors</h3> <p dir="ltr">HLP depositors also earn points for every HLP contributed during each epoch. To earn points as a HLP depositor, you can:</p> <ul> <li aria-level="1" dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Earn 2 points for every 1 HLP contributed to the pool during each epoch (note that a snapshot will be taken at a random time during each epoch).</p> </li> <li aria-level="1" dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Points are reset to 0 at the end of each epoch.</p> </li> <li aria-level="1" dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Passive HLP depositors will continue to accumulate points as long as they are providing HLP to HMX. </p> </li> </ul> <p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Gold Passes are distributed at a similar rate of every 1,000 points accumulated, where users must hold at least 500 HLP on Blast to receive 1 Gold Pass.</p> <h3 dir="ltr">Winner Selection Strategy</h3> <div dir="ltr"><img alt="Golden Slam" loading="lazy" src="https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/10223/content_Golden_Slam.webp" style="width: 1200px; height: 891px;"></div> <p dir="ltr">The Gold Passes for Traders and HLP depositors are drawn in a pool with a prize of 20 Blast Gold for each epoch draw. For every Gold Pass added to the drawing pool, four extra Gold Passes are added, therefore, there is only a 20% probability that an HMX user will hold a winning Gold Pass for each epoch – which results in bigger prize pools for following draws! At time of writing, the prize pool for Epoch #3 sits at 60 Blast Gold.</p> <p dir="ltr">In cases where the Gold Pass drawn is not held by a HMX user, the 20 Blast Gold will be rolled over to the draw for the next epoch. The prizes for the epochs grow as the prize for the previous epoch is rolled over.</p> <p dir="ltr">For each winning gold pass, the holder must claim their prizes within 72 hours or 72 epochs, or the reward will roll over into the prize pool of the next epoch.</p> <p dir="ltr">Want to start trading on HMX?

<title>What Is Grass.io and How to Earn Points for a Potential Airdrop</title>
<content type="html"><h2 dir="ltr">How to Earn Grass Points</h2> <p dir="ltr">You can earn Grass points by downloading and running Grass as an extension of your web browser while you browse the internet. Based on information from the protocol, Grass may potentially distribute rewards in the form of cryptocurrencies, gift cards, and Paypal. </p> <hr> <h3 dir="ltr">Key Takeaways </h3> <ul> <li aria-level="1" dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Grass enables you to generate passive income by leveraging your unused bandwidth without compromising your privacy. Verified companies can utilize your idle bandwidth securely, without accessing any of your personal information.</p> </li> <li aria-level="1" dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr" role="presentation">In 2023, Grass raised a $3.5 million seed round led by Polychain Capital, Tribe Capital and other notable investors. </p> </li> <li aria-level="1" dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Grass grants users Grass points as they serve as node operators by providing data via internet bandwidth.</p> </li> </ul> <hr> <div dir="ltr"><img alt="What is Grass Grass Points Airdrop" src="https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/10215/content_What_is_Grass_Grass_Points_Airdrop.webp" style="width: 1200px; height: 600px;"></div> <p dir="ltr">With the global big data market set to<a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/254266/global-big-data-market-forecast/#:~:text=Advanced%20analytics%20tools%2C%20such%20as,billion%20U.S.%20dollars%20in%202022." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"> triple by 2027</a>, growth in demand for AI products continues to grow exponentially, and the cost to obtain data to train AI models continues to rise in tandem. Grass presents an opportunity for node operators to passively earn with an extension that operates in the background. </p> <p dir="ltr">In December 2023, Grass announced the successful completion of a <a href="http://www.getgrass.io/blog/grass-raises-3-5-million-seed-round-to" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">$3.5 million seed round</a> led by Polychain Capital and Tribe Capital. Other participating investors include Bitscale, Big Brain, Advisors Anonymous, Typhon V, Mozaik and angel investors such as Sami Kassab, Stephy Dunbar and Kunal Goel. This brings Grass’s total funding to $4.5 million after a pre-seed round led by No Limit Holdings. </p> <p dir="ltr">While a Grass token has not been announced, information from the protocol suggests that there will be rewards from Grass, This may take the form of “cryptocurrencies, gift cards, and PayPal.”</p> <h2 dir="ltr">How Does Grass Work?</h2> <p dir="ltr">Grass is a network that lets people sell the internet bandwidth they are not using. It operates as a decentralized network for web scraping, aiming to transform public web data into AI datasets for builders use. This is achieved by leveraging idle internet connections of node operators to collect raw data, which is then processed for AI training purposes. Grass employs its in-house AI development tool developed by <a href="https://www.wyndlabs.ai/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Wynd Labs</a>, Socrates, to extract unstructured data and convert it into a readable format. Think of Grass as an AI data repository, furnishing data to various AI platforms seeking training for their specific models.</p> <div dir="ltr"><span style="font-size:11px;"><img alt="Grass Data Layer" loading="lazy" src="https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/10210/content_Grass_Data_Layer.webp" style="width: 1000px; height: 563px;"></span></div> <div dir="ltr"><span style="font-size:11px;">Source: <a href="https://www.getgrass.io/blog/grass-is-the-data-layer-of-ai" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://www.getgrass.io/blog/grass-is-the-data-layer-of-ai</a></span></div> <p dir="ltr">Furthermore, Grass serves as a data layer for AI, by prioritizing transparency and trust by implementing data recording each time data is scraped by Grass nodes. To handle large-scale scraping operations effectively, Grass is developed as a <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/learn/what-are-layer-2-crypto-protocols" target="_blank">Layer 2</a> solution on top of <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/solana" target="_blank">Solana</a>, utilizing it as a settlement layer through a sovereign rollup mechanism.</p> <p dir="ltr">Moreover, Grass incorporates a ZK processor, enabling builders to verify that AI models are trained correctly, along with a Data Ledger designed to host an extensive data repository. </p> <p dir="ltr">The ZK processor plays a key role in tracing the origins of the datasets collected from Grass, it pinpoints the exact moment when a dataset comes into existence. This process typically begins with the user of the Grass extension making a web request on the website where the response contains encrypted data and marks the dataset’s origin. Employing <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/learn/zero-knowledge-proofs-and-zk-rollups" target="_blank">zero knowledge proofs</a> to bundle data, allows for a high volume of web requests while ensuring that the AI training data remains intact and verifiable, reinforcing the accuracy and integrity of AI Models.</p> <p dir="ltr">The Data Ledger on the other hand is the primary storage location for all datasets scraped from Grass. It acts as a permanent record, containing embedded metadata that document each dataset from the point of origin. This repository strategically scrapes data curated for <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/learn/ai-crypto-chatbot" target="_blank">LLM </a>training purposes and is strategically positioned to combat data poisoning, support open-source AI endeavours, and enhance user understanding of AI models.</p> <p dir="ltr">Grass utilizes a simple browser extension to take advantage of a user’s idle internet connection to scrape data. The extension prioritizes user privacy by abstaining from any collection or sharing of identifiable user data with third parties. No personal data, including browsing history, search terms, emails, or files, is tracked or stored by Grass or Wynd Labs. Instead, the extension anonymously utilizes a portion of your bandwidth resources when installed and enabled. Its functionality is strictly limited to channelling bandwidth without accessing any sensitive data.</p> <p dir="ltr">Wynd Network also goes beyond internal security measures by engaging independent cybersecurity firms to conduct frequent and thorough audits of the Grass software. These external security reviews are extensive, aiming to identify and address vulnerabilities effectively, thus enhancing defence mechanisms against potential threats. </p> <p dir="ltr">Founder, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrej-r-1b7baa1a4/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Andrej Radonjic</a>, has revealed himself along with 5 other employees on Linkedin, and they collectively share similar backgrounds in Software Engineering and building DeFi protocols. With his prior experiences in his previous venture in 1on1proxy, a provider of static residential proxies Andrej also completed his Bachelor of Engineering at McMaster University while his team have backgrounds in universities residing majority from the Asian regions like the Philippines and Bangladesh. According to <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/andrej-radonjic" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Crunchbase</a>, Andrej Radonjic had also made pre-seed investments in <a href="http://rug.ai" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Rug.ai</a> earlier in March 2024. </p> <p dir="ltr">During a presentation at ETH Denver last month, founder Andrej Radonjic shared that Grass has been downloaded in 190 countries, and it collects over 1 TB of data daily. Despite Grass's massive growth in recent months, it's still behind another app, Honeygain, which has about 12 million users. </p> <h2 dir="ltr">Grass Points Valuation</h2> <p dir="ltr">As of the time of writing, the average bids and ask per grass point costs $0.00266 and $0.00258 respectively, these are the points market found on <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/learn/pre-markets-crypto-whales-market" target="_blank">Whales Market</a>. Whales Market is a popular decentralized OTC decentralized exchange for trading Airdrop Allocations, Points and Tokens. Although this platform is a speculative tool for traders to predict prices of pre-launched tokens/points, instances like <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ether-fi" target="_blank">Ether.fi</a>, <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/zeus-network" target="_blank">Zeus Network</a>, and <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethena" target="_blank">Ethena </a>Shards nearly matched the actual prices upon launch.</p> <div><span style="font-size:11px;"><img alt="whales market grass price" loading="lazy" src="https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/10094/content_picture_2.webp"></span></div> <div><span style="font-size:11px;">Source: <a href="https://pro.whales.market/points/Solana/Grass" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">pro.whales.market/points/Solana/Grass </a></span></div> <div> </div> <h2 dir="ltr">How to Earn Grass Points</h2> <p dir="ltr">Anyone can also earn Grass points as the project is now its incentivized beta phase.</p> <h3 dir="ltr">Step 1: Download Grass</h3> <div dir="ltr">Visit <a href="https://www.getgrass.io/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://www.getgrass.io/</a> and Download Grass.<br> <img alt="Get Grass " loading="lazy" src="https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/10211/content_get_grass_add_to_chrome.webp" style="width: 1200px; height: 799px;"> </div> <p dir="ltr">Add Grass to Chrome.</p> <div dir="ltr"><img alt="Add Grass to Chrome" loading="lazy" src="https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/10212/content_add_to_chrome_grass.webp" style="width: 1200px; height: 598px;"></div> <p dir="ltr">There will be a popup which allows you to add Grass as an extension.

Note that you will need a referral code to sign up for Grass – you can look for referral codes on Twitter (X).</div> <p dir="ltr"><strong>Note that there is no need to connect your cryptocurrency wallet to Grass</strong>.</p> <h3 dir="ltr">Step 3: Earn Points on Grass</h3> <p dir="ltr">You will be brought to the main Dashboard for Grass. </p> <p dir="ltr">Click on Connect and your device will be connected to the internet you are currently using. </p> <p dir="ltr">You are now officially a node operator for Grass and will earn Grass points as long as you have a connection with the internet.</p> <div dir="ltr"><img alt="Grass dashboard" loading="lazy" src="https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/10101/content_picture_9.webp"></div> <div dir="ltr"> </div> <h3 dir="ltr">Earn More Points Through Referrals</h3> <p dir="ltr">In addition to the Grass Points you earn directly, you can enhance your earnings by referring other users to Grass. Simply utilize your personalized referral code or link to enroll new users, and you'll receive a perpetual 20% bonus based on all the Grass Points generated by their accounts. Your referral rewards persist as long as the user accounts you referred remain active on Grass. As their points accumulate, your bonus points also increase automatically. By consistently referring to even a small group of users, you can significantly boost your Grass Points earnings over time through this compounding effect.</p> <h2 dir="ltr">Conclusion</h2> <p dir="ltr">Grass is a decentralized Layer 2 network built on top of Solana which accesses the public web to scrape data in order to train AI models. By scraping and processing raw data from the public web provided by node operators, Grass cleans and converts the raw data into structured datasets used for AI training. With the introduction of Grass points, the protocol aims to incentivize users to provide access to the public web by running nodes using Chrome extensions.</p> </content>

Carbon is designed to meet the needs and expectations of regular users, offering fast page load times while blocking online ads and web trackers. At the same time, Carbon also caters to the web3 community as it offers users an integrated multichain wallet and integrated swapping and bridging facilities. </p> <p dir="ltr">Users can earn Carbon’s token, <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/carbon-browser" target="_blank">CSIX</a> by navigating using the browser. These tokens can then be used to upgrade to a premium browsing experience, staked for increased rewards, and more.</p> <h2 dir="ltr">Carbon Browser vs. Other Browsers</h2> <p dir="ltr">Carbon and Brave are the two of the most popular web3 browsers. Both browsers cater to web3 users, incorporating features like a crypto wallet and supporting ENS domains. However, Carbon Browser delivers a faster browsing experience, while also allowing users to earn rewards without requiring them to pass KYC checks, and will also offer free VPN and firewall for its users. </p> <p dir="ltr">While Chrome is the most popular browser, with 64% market share based on SimilarWeb data, it doesn’t offer privacy options or adblock by default. It also doesn’t support web3 features by default, although users can download a variety of extensions on the Chrome desktop browser. </p> <div dir="ltr"><img alt="Carbon vs Other Browsers" loading="lazy" src="https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/10150/content_Carbon_vs_Other_Browsers.webp" style="width: 1200px; height: 806px;"></div> <p dir="ltr">Now, let’s take a closer look at Carbon Browser’s features.</p> <h2 dir="ltr">Features of Carbon Browser</h2> <p dir="ltr">Some of the key features of the Carbon Browser include;</p> <h3 dir="ltr">Privacy</h3> <p dir="ltr">According to Carbon Browser, its users’ data privacy is of utmost importance. It allows users to not only use the application without providing personal information but also manage other areas of their browsing data. Carbon is a non-KYC browser; no registrations are required to use available features including the reward programs and token staking portal. </p> <p dir="ltr">While still in development, Carbon will be offering its users privacy options like decentralized VPN and firewall. These applications will be free to use, allowing every user to encrypt their personal data while accessing the internet. </p> <p dir="ltr">As the Carbon Browser is open source, anyone can audit the codebase and also contribute to it, and therefore verify the data management practices of the application. Advanced privacy options are also available for Carbon Pro users.</p> <h3 dir="ltr">Web3 Support</h3> <p dir="ltr">Carbon is a web3 browser. It has decentralized applications and protocols integrated by default and is also developed with technologies that enable developers to integrate their decentralized applications. Web3-related activities and applications supported by Carbon Browser include the staking program for the CSIX token, support for decentralized exchanges, and decentralized domains like <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/learn/what-is-ethereum-name-service-and-how-does-it-work" target="_blank">ENS</a>, <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/learn/what-is-unstoppable-domains-and-how-does-it-work" target="_blank">Unstoppable Domains</a>, and <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/learn/what-is-a-handshake-name" target="_blank">Handshake</a>. Users can also access external decentralized services from their Carbon Browser interface.</p> <p dir="ltr">Carbon also features a multichain cryptocurrency wallet that enables users to send and receive crypto, along with a staking platform and swaps on LDX.fi. Carbon also makes it easy for users to browse and interact with dApps on the browser, supporting categories ranging from DeFi to NFT and infrastructure. </p> <h3 dir="ltr">Improved Browsing Experience</h3> <p dir="ltr">In addition to strong user data privacy principles and support for web3 applications, Carbon delivers blazing fast browsing speed. According to the project, the browser has a load time of just 0.5 seconds. This is about four times faster than that recorded for the Chrome browser – the second fastest browser according to data provided by Carbon. According to the project, the browser's recorded speed is thanks to the optimization in the core browser engine and also the routing operation of the browser. </p> <p dir="ltr">Another key element of Carbon’s improved browsing experience is its ad-blocking features. Carbon cites high-resolution ads and their high frequency as one of the contributors to loading lags that occur while accessing the internet. By getting rid of ads using its ad-blocking technology, Carbon frees up resources for the normal web page to load.</p> <p dir="ltr">In line with its goal of improving ad management, Carbon Browser has partnered with Verasity – a cryptocurrency project working on anti-ad fraud technologies. Carbon Browser integrates Verasity’s Proof-of-View (PoV), where if ads are shown on whitelisted sites, PoV ensures they’re free of fraud, making Carbon Browser a safer environment. Verasity is listed on the Carbon Browser dApp store, with support for the VRA token on its exchanges and wallet.</p> <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"> <p dir="ltr" lang="en">𝗡𝗘𝗪 𝗣𝗔𝗥𝗧𝗡𝗘𝗥𝗦𝗛𝗜𝗣 𝗜𝗡𝗧𝗘𝗚𝗥𝗔𝗧𝗜𝗢𝗡 🔥<br> <br> Carbon has teamed up with <a href="https://twitter.com/verasitytech?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@VerasityTech</a> to explore anti ad-fraud integration options for <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/CarbonBrowser?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#CarbonBrowser</a> and our 7M+ users.<br> <br> The 1st patented <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/adtech?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#adtech</a> protocol on the blockchain is making its way to <a href="https://twitter.com/trycarbonio?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@trycarbonio</a> to keep… <a href="https://t.co/FlKXUJfEEj">pic.twitter.com/FlKXUJfEEj</a></p> — Carbon Browser (@trycarbonio) <a href="https://twitter.com/trycarbonio/status/1717937736861065418?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 27, 2023</a> </blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> <h3 dir="ltr">Rewards</h3> <p dir="ltr">Carbon Browser offers rewards to users via its Browse-to-Earn program. Every user is eligible for the reward program, no KYC verification is required. Users earn Carbon Points for performing specific operations on the browser. Reward earned depends on user activities and region. The amount earned for activities varies for supported regions. According to the project, the reward amount will be adjusted regularly based on supply and demand conditions. Reward distribution is meant to commence in Q1 2024 and will be distributed monthly.</p> <p dir="ltr">Carbon Browser also offers extra earning opportunities through its staking program. CSIX token holders can stake their tokens on the staking portal and earn token rewards according to the APR. CSIX is a <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/learn/bep-2-vs-bep-20-vs-erc-20" target="_blank">BEP-20</a> minted on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) and the native token of the Carbon Browser.</p> <h2 dir="ltr">Apps on Carbon Browser Store</h2> <p dir="ltr"><a href="https://carbon.website/app-store/" target="_blank">Carbon Browser’s App store</a> is a catalog of applications that can be installed and used on the browser. According to the project, it is the world's first and largest app store optimized for web3 browsers. Some applications in the store include;</p> <h3 dir="ltr">Unizen Protocol – Liquidity Solution for DeFi and Interoperability Protocol for Multichain</h3> <p dir="ltr">Following the partnership with Carbon, Unizen is now supported on Carbon Browser. The project’s token is available on the Carbon Wallet and the application can be accessed on the Carbon app store. </p> <p dir="ltr">Unizen is a liquidity and interoperability solution for decentralized finance. It enables users to interact with different web3 applications from the same interface. It allows swap requests to be routed across multiple <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/learn/liquidity-pools-crypto-defi" target="_blank">liquidity pools</a> and exchanges to select the best route for each operation, enabling users to get the best rate for their swaps. As an interoperability solution, it developed the <a href="https://docs.unizen.io/unizen-core-concepts/unizen-interoperability-protocol-uip" target="_blank">Unizen Interoperability Protocol (UIP)</a>, a decentralized protocol that enables users to move crypto assets easily between different blockchain networks.</p> <p dir="ltr">As a partner project, Unizen is integrated into Carbon Browser’s LDX.fi DeFi platform. Users of the platform will be able to utilize Unizen’s infrastructure</p> <h3 dir="ltr">Nakamoto Games – Play to Earn Ecosystem for Decentralized Games</h3> <p dir="ltr">Nakamoto Games is a multi-game GameFi application that allows gamers to earn while playing the games available in its ecosystem. It creates a hub for decentralized games and incentivizes gamers to play by distributing rewards based on user activities. Nakamoto Games plans to develop over 300 games for various devices and build an economy for gamers on its platform. </p> <p dir="ltr">As part of its partnership with Carbon, the Nakamoto Games application is available on the Carbon Browser app store, and the project’s native token is also supported on the Carbon Browser wallet. Gamers will also be able to access Carbon Browser via Nakamoto Games.</p> <h2 dir="ltr">Carbon Launchpad – Mirada AI</h2> <p dir="ltr">Carbon announced <a href="https://mirada.ai/" target="_blank">Mirada AI</a> as the first project to launch via its launchpad. The Carbon Launchpad is a platform that enables new projects to kickstart their journey via fundraisers. The Carbon Launchpad is an IDO platform that enables investor subscriptions and token sale events for new projects. In addition to managing the financial aspect of new project launches, Carbon Launchpad also helps new projects with marketing programs for their IDO and technical support. Mirada AI, the first project to launch via this platform is scheduled to go live on May 1 following a pushback of the initial sale date set for April 30.</p> <h3 dir="ltr">What Is Mirada AI?</h3> <div dir="ltr"><img alt="Mirada AI" loading="lazy" src="https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/10149/content_Mirada_AI.webp" style="width: 1200px; height: 400px;"></div> <p dir="ltr">Mirada is a decentralized AI application powered by the Mirada token (MIRX). It is a text and multimedia generation AI client that enables users to produce high-resolution graphics and text using prompts. The Mirada AI chatbot powered by its AI algorithm is already integrated into chat applications – Telegram and Discord. Users can send text prompts to the chatbot and receive text responses generated via the LLM application, Mirada’s chatbot can also be added to chat groups on the platforms. According to the project, the web-based client for the chatbot is in the beta testing stages. Mirada AI is also able to generate audio files and animations, upscale images and perform face swaps.</p> <p dir="ltr">Usage statistics provided by the project claim that over 30,000 images have been generated by about 5,000 confirmed users. Mirada AI is expected to intensify efforts in its technology after the launch event on Carbon Launchpad; it hopes to close the fundraiser even with an FDV of $10 million.</p> <h3 dir="ltr">How to Participate in the Mirada AI Launchpad Event</h3> <p dir="ltr">According to Carbon, <a href="https://carbon.website/mirada-ai-ido-set-for-launch-on-carbon-launchpad/" target="_blank">eligibility for participation in the IDO event is via a whitelisting process</a>. The primary criteria for joining the whitelist include:</p> <ul> <li aria-level="1" dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Staking at least 1,000 CSIX tokens on the official staking portal on or before April 28, 2024. </p> </li> <li aria-level="1" dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Investors who intend to participate in the token sale event will also have to undergo a KYC verification process. </p> </li> </ul> <p dir="ltr">The whitelisting process will commence on May 1 and the whitelisting result will be announced 48 hours before the IDO event begins. Users who meet these criteria will be able to invest in the project in its early stages.</p> <p dir="ltr">After the token sale event, IDO participants will receive 15% of the MIRX tokens purchased during the token sale event, this will be followed by a 1-month cliff, and then a linear <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/learn/crypto-vesting-schedules" target="_blank">vesting</a> over 6 months. Carbon Launchpad will manage the IDO whitelisting event while Poolz will manage the token claim process after the launch event has been completed. According to the project, the token listing will be completed within 24 hours after the IDO event.</p> <h2 dir="ltr">Final Thoughts</h2> <p dir="ltr">Carbon Browser applies decentralized technology and anti-censorship principles in one of the sectors that are in most need of it – the internet. It has over 7 million users and the daily usage statistics suggest a growing interest in internet services that take users’ privacy seriously. In addition, it offers users an improved browsing experience with fast loading speed and adblocks. Carbon Browser also makes it easy for users to interact with web3 services through its integrated wallet, bridge, and exchange. </p> <p dir="ltr">The addition of a launchpad to its ecosystem will enable new projects to launch under the guidance of a much older and more resourceful project. Projects could use the expertise of the advisory team and the technological resources put in place by the Carbon Browser project. Mirada AI is the first project to launch via Carbon’s launchpad and could be the first of many more to come. </p> <p dir="ltr">Having said this, it is important to perform due research before investing in any project.

It offers an ecosystem where users can interact with each other more dynamically and engagingly. One of the unique features of Farcaster is its API, which allows developers to create interactive applications within the Farcaster ecosystem.</p> <h2 dir="ltr">Farcaster Frames: Interactive In-Feed Apps</h2> <p dir="ltr">A recent addition to the Farcaster platform, <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/learn/what-is-farcaster-warpcast-crypto?utm_campaign=learn&amp;utm_content=farcaster-frames-tutorial" target="_blank">Frames</a> is an innovative feature that transforms the way users interact on their social feeds. Instead of clicking on a link and being redirected, users can now interact with applications within their social feed. This means they can perform actions, such as using an app, minting an NFT and even tracking crypto prices <em>without leaving their feed</em>. This interactive in-feed app enhances the user experience by making it more seamless and engaging, while keeping users within the platform.</p> <p dir="ltr">In today's guide, we'll be walking through how to build a Farcaster Frame using CoinGecko API's trending pools data. Let's jump in!</p> <hr> <p dir="ltr"><img alt="A beginner's guide to building a Farcaster Frame" src="https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/10180/content_How_to_Build_a_Farcaster_Frame_with_Next_JS_-_Trending_Crypto_Pools.webp" style="width: 1200px; height: 597px;"></p> <h2 dir="ltr">Prerequisites</h2> <p dir="ltr">To follow along with this tutorial, make sure you have the following installed:</p> <ul dir="ltr"> <li role="presentation"> <strong>CoinGecko API</strong>: We’ll use this to fetch <a href="https://docs.coingecko.com/reference/trending-pools-list?utm_campaign=learn&amp;utm_content=farcaster-frames-tutorial" target="_blank">onchain DEX endpoints</a> to get data for the top trending crypto pools. As this is a paid exclusive endpoint, you'll need to minimally be subscribed to the Analyst API plan. Ensure you have your Pro API key on hand.</li> <li role="presentation"> <strong>Node.js and npm</strong>: Node.js is a JavaScript runtime that lets you run JavaScript on your server or computer. npm is a package manager for Node.js. You can download both from the official Node.js website.</li> <li role="presentation"> <strong>Text Editor or IDE</strong>: You’ll need a text editor or an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) to write your code. Some popular choices include Sublime Text, Atom, Visual Studio Code, and PyCharm. For this tutorial, we’ll use Visual Studio Code.</li> <li role="presentation"> <strong>Vercel</strong>: You will need to create a <a href="https://vercel.com/?utm_campaign=learn&amp;utm_content=farcaster-frames-tutorial" target="_blank">Vercel</a> account to publicly deploy our frames and do the testing</li> <li role="presentation"> <strong>Warpcast and Neynar account</strong>: You’ll need an account on Warpcast to test the app. Also, you’ll need a Neynar account API key.</li> </ul> <h3 dir="ltr">OpenGraph: Enhancing Social Media Sharing</h3> <p>To enhance your Next.js application’s visibility on social media, I recommend incorporating OpenGraph meta tags. These tags help dictate how your content is displayed when shared, making it more appealing and shareable, and allows for richer previews of shared content, including titles, descriptions, and images. Here’s a sample code snippet:</p> <pre dir="ltr"> <code>&lt;meta property="og:title" content="Title Here" /&gt; &lt;meta property="og:description" content="Description Here" /&gt; &lt;meta property="og:image" content="Image URL Here" /&gt;</code></pre> <h3 dir="ltr">Creating a Next.js App</h3> <p dir="ltr">Next.js is a popular framework for building React applications. It supports server-side rendering (SSR), which improves performance and SEO. Here are the steps to create a Next.js app in Visual Studio Code:</p> <ol dir="ltr"> <li role="presentation">Open Visual Studio Code.</li> <li role="presentation">Open the terminal (View -&gt; Terminal).</li> <li role="presentation">Run npx create-next-app@latest.</li> </ol> <p dir="ltr">Finally, let’s dive into the actual code.</p> <h3 dir="ltr">Page.tsx</h3> <script src="https://gist.github.com/rollendxavier/4539be92e878c21011b978be5feb10af.js"></script> <p dir="ltr">This code is part of a Next.js application. It’s written in TypeScript and is meant to be placed in a page.tsx file. The code is responsible for creating a page that displays a Farcaster Frame powered by CoinGecko.</p> <ol> <li aria-level="1" dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>Importing necessary modules and types</strong>: The code starts by importing the necessary modules and types. getFrameMetadata is a function from the @coinbase/onchainkit package that helps generate metadata for a Farcaster Frame. Metadata is a type imported from ‘next’ that defines the shape of the metadata object.</p> </li> <li aria-level="1" dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>Defining frame metadata</strong>: The frameMetadata constant is an object that contains the metadata for the Farcaster Frame. This includes the buttons that will be displayed on the frame, the image that will be used, and the URL that will be posted when a button is clicked.</p> </li> <li aria-level="1" dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>Defining page metadata</strong>: The metadata constant is an object that contains the metadata for the page. This includes the base URL, the title and description of the page, and the OpenGraph data. The other property of the metadata object is spread with the frameMetadata object, which means all properties of frameMetadata are included in the metadata object.</p> </li> <li aria-level="1" dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>Exporting the page component</strong>: Finally, the Page component is exported. This is a functional component that returns a JSX element. In this case, it’s a simple heading welcoming users to the page.</p> </li> </ol> <p dir="ltr">The <code>getFrameMetadata</code> function is important because it generates the necessary metadata for a Farcaster Frame. This metadata is used by Farcaster to correctly display the frame within the social feed.</p> <p dir="ltr">The export const metadata: <code>Metadata = {...}</code> line is crucial because it exports the metadata for the page. This metadata is used by Next.js for server-side rendering and by search engines and social media platforms for displaying rich previews of the page. It’s also used by Farcaster to display the frame within the social feed. The Metadata type ensures that the metadata object has the correct shape.</p> <h3 dir="ltr">trendingPools/route.ts</h3> <script src="https://gist.github.com/rollendxavier/25fcfa018fffdaf0cdaff20c5dac34f7.js"></script> <p dir="ltr">This code is part of a Next.js serverless function. It’s written in TypeScript and is meant to be placed in an API route file. The code is responsible for handling POST requests and returning a Farcaster Frame powered by CoinGecko.</p> <ol> <li aria-level="1" dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>Importing necessary modules and types</strong>: The code starts by importing the necessary modules and types. <code>FrameRequest</code>, <code>getFrameMessage</code>, and <code>getFrameHtmlResponse</code> are functions from the <code>@coinbase/onchainkit</code> package that help generate and validate Farcaster Frames. NextRequest and NextResponse are types imported from ‘next/server’ that define the shape of the request and response objects.</p> </li> <li aria-level="1" dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>Defining the <code>getResponse </code>function</strong>: The getResponse function is an asynchronous function that takes a NextRequest object and returns a NextResponse object. It starts by initializing several variables and then validates the request body using the <code>getFrameMessage </code>function.</p> </li> <li aria-level="1" dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>Fetching data from CoinGecko</strong>: If the request is valid, the function fetches data from the CoinGecko API and processes it. It then uses this data to generate chart options and fetches a chart image from the QuickChart API.</p> </li> <li aria-level="1" dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>Handling button clicks</strong>: If the second button is clicked, the function redirects the user to the CoinGecko website. Otherwise, it generates a Farcaster Frame with the chart image and returns it as a response.</p> </li> <li aria-level="1" dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>Error handling</strong>: If an error occurs at any point, the function returns an error image.</p> </li> <li aria-level="1" dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>Exporting the POST function</strong>: Finally, the <code>POST</code> function is exported. This function simply calls the getResponse function with the request object and returns its result.</p> </li> </ol> <p dir="ltr">The getFrameMessage function is important because it validates the request body and extracts the message from it. This message contains information about any buttons that were clicked in the Farcaster Frame.</p> <p dir="ltr">The <code>export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic';</code> line is crucial because it tells Next.js to always render this page on the server, regardless of whether it could be statically optimized. This is necessary because the content of the page depends on the request body, which can only be accessed on the server.</p> <h2 dir="ltr">Running the Next.js Application Locally</h2> <p dir="ltr">To run your Next.js application locally, follow these steps:</p> <ol> <li aria-level="1" dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>Open Terminal</strong>: Open a terminal window on your computer.</p> </li> <li aria-level="1" dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>Navigate to Your Project Directory</strong>: Use the cd command to navigate to your project directory. For example, if your project is in a folder called my-next-app, you would type cd my-next-app.</p> </li> <li aria-level="1" dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>Install Dependencies</strong>: If you haven’t already, install the project’s dependencies by running npm install.</p> </li> <li aria-level="1" dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>Start the Development Server</strong>: Start the Next.js development server by running npm run dev. This will start the server on<code> localhost:3000</code> (unless you’ve configured a different port).</p> </li> </ol> <p dir="ltr">Now, you can open your web browser and navigate to <code>http://localhost:3000</code> to see your application running.</p> <h2 dir="ltr">Running Farcaster Frames Tests Locally</h2> <p dir="ltr">To run Farcaster Frames tests locally using the OnChainKit, follow these steps:</p> <ol> <li aria-level="1" dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>Clone the OnChainKit Repository</strong>: First, you need to clone the OnChainKit repository from GitHub. You can do this by running git clone https://github.com/coinbase/onchainkit.git in your terminal.</p> </li> <li aria-level="1" dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>Navigate to the Framegear Directory</strong>: The tests for Farcaster Frames are located in the framegear directory within the OnChainKit repository. Navigate to this directory by running cd onchainkit/framegear.</p> </li> <li aria-level="1" dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>Install Dependencies</strong>: Install the project’s dependencies by running npm install.</p> </li> <li aria-level="1" dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>Run the Tests</strong>: Finally, run the tests by executing npm run dev which will start the application on ‘<a href="http://localhost:1337">http://localhost:1337</a>’ and you can paste your application url <a href="http://localhost:3000">http://localhost:3000</a> to the frames validator to test this</p> </li> </ol> <p dir="ltr"><img alt="Running Farcaster Frames Tests Locally" loading="lazy" src="https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/10181/content_Farcaster_3.webp" style="width: 992px; height: 683px;"></p> <p dir="ltr">Remember, running tests is a crucial part of the development process. It helps you catch and fix issues before they affect your users. So, take your time, test thoroughly, and ensure your Farcaster Frame works perfectly.</p> <h2 dir="ltr">Deploying the Application on Vercel</h2> <p dir="ltr">Once you’ve tested your application and are satisfied with its functionality, the next step is to deploy it. Vercel is a popular platform for deploying Next.js applications. Here’s how you can deploy your application using Vercel:</p> <ol> <li aria-level="1" dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>Push Your Changes to GitHub</strong>: First, make sure all your changes are committed and pushed to your GitHub repository. If you haven’t already, initialize a Git repository in your project directory, commit your changes, and push them to GitHub.</p> </li> </ol> <p dir="ltr" style="margin-left: 40px;"><code>git init</code></p> <p dir="ltr" style="margin-left: 40px;"><code>git add .</code></p> <p dir="ltr" style="margin-left: 40px;"><code>git commit -m "Initial commit"</code></p> <p dir="ltr" style="margin-left: 40px;"><code>git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepository.git</code></p> <p dir="ltr" style="margin-left: 40px;"><code>git push -u origin master</code></p> <ol start="2"> <li aria-level="1" dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>Connect Your GitHub Repository to Vercel</strong>: Next, go to the Vercel dashboard and click on the “Import Project” button.

<title>Meme Coins: The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly</title>
<content type="html"><div><img alt="Memecoins" src="https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/10173/content_Memecoins.webp" style="width: 1200px; height: 600px;"></div> <p><em>This article is brought to you by FBS.</em></p> <p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.coingecko.com/learn/what-are-meme-coins-why-are-they-so-popular" target="_blank">Meme coins</a>, a quirky subset of cryptocurrencies, are inspired by internet memes, injecting humor and novelty into digital assets. With their lighthearted origins and unpredictable trajectories, meme coins exemplify the playful spirit of internet culture, offering both entertainment and investment opportunities in equal measure. A prime example is the Dogecoin (DOGE) that emerged in 2013 as a satirical take on the crypto frenzy – it quickly gained traction thanks to its vibrant community and viral appeal on platforms like Reddit.  </p> <p dir="ltr">In this article, <a href="https://fbs.com/?utm_source=finanalysts&amp;utm_medium=coingecko&amp;utm_campaign=memecoins" target="_blank">FBS</a> financial markets analysts explore the landscape of meme coins dividing them into two broad parts – “the good” and “the bad and the ugly”. The experts look at the inception of memecoins and evaluate the potential impact of these assets on the broader cryptocurrency market.</p> <div> <br> <img alt="Top Narratives Q1 2024 Memecoins" loading="lazy" src="https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/10151/content_Top_Narratives_Q1_2024_Memecoins.webp" style="width: 989px; height: 1166px;"> </div> <div> </div> <h2 dir="ltr">The Good</h2> <p dir="ltr">Several projects have emerged as noteworthy contenders within meme coins, demonstrating their reliability and dedication to the meme community.</p> <div style="text-align: center;"> <br> <img alt="Meme Tokens trade volume" loading="lazy" src="https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/10152/content_Meme_Tokens_trade_volume.webp" style="width: 1051px; height: 526px;"> </div> <div dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;">Trading volumes of the largest meme coins</div> <p dir="ltr">As highlighted earlier, Dogecoin stands out as the pioneer of meme coins, boasting the largest market capitalization in the space. However, beyond Dogecoin, there are other notable participants worth considering such as Shiba Inu (SHIB), Pepe (PEPE),  Floki (FLOKI), and Bonk (BONK).</p> <h3 dir="ltr">Shiba Inu (SHIB)</h3> <p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/shiba-inu" target="_blank">Shiba Inu (SHIB)</a> appeared in 2020. Unlike Dogecoin, the creator of Shiba Inu remains anonymous and is only known to the crypto community as RYOSHI. Interestingly, the creators of SHIB did not keep any tokens for themselves, ensuring that all buyers entered the market on an equal footing. </p> <div dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size:11px;"><img alt="SHIB" loading="lazy" src="https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/10153/content_SHIB.webp" style="width: 200px; height: 200px;"><br> Shiba Inu (SHIB)</span></div> <p dir="ltr">Despite a quiet start, SHIB gained significant momentum in March 2021 when Elon Musk's tweet expressing interest in a Shiba Inu puppy inadvertently boosted the coin's popularity. This led to SHIB becoming one of the top 20 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, with its value soaring 2,000 percent in just five days and more than 27 million percent between January and October 2021. In October 2021, an unknown large buyer spent $1.2 million on SHIB tokens. To maintain its value, the creators of Shiba Inu have created an ecosystem consisting of three tokens, SHIB, <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/doge-killer" target="_blank">LEASH</a>, and <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bone-shibaswap" target="_blank">BONE</a>, and a decentralized exchange, ShibaSwap. Technically, Shiba Inu operates as an ERC-20 token on the Ethereum blockchain.</p> <h3 dir="ltr">Pepe (PEPE)</h3> <p dir="ltr">Pepe, a green frog with a turbulent history, first rose to prominence among American far-right political groups before being reincarnated in April 2023 as the most popular meme coin. Despite the <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/pepe" target="_blank">PEPE</a> cryptocurrency's frenzy, the original artist behind the Pepe character claims not to have profited from its crypto iteration. With a total supply of 420 trillion PEPE tokens, a nod to the marijuana-related meme "4.20," its market capitalization reached $1 billion within three weeks of launch. Within slightly over a month, this cryptocurrency saw a staggering 10,000-fold increase in value.</p> <div dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;"> <span style="font-size:11px;"><img alt="Pepe" loading="lazy" src="https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/10154/content_Pepe.webp" style="width: 200px; height: 200px;"><br> Pepe (PEPE)</span><br>  </div> <h3 dir="ltr">Floki (FLOKI)</h3> <p dir="ltr">In June 2021, Elon Musk announced on Twitter that he would name his pet Shiba Inu as “Floki”, which prompted the creation of the Floki Inu coin. When Musk announced on 12 September that his family had acquired the dog, <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/floki" target="_blank">FLOKI</a> tokens were already actively traded on the market. </p> <div dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size:11px;"><img alt="Floki" loading="lazy" src="https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/10155/content_Floki.webp" style="width: 200px; height: 200px;"><br> Floki (FLOKI)</span></div> <p dir="ltr">Over the past year, Floki has grown 287%, bringing its market value to $1.54 billion. Despite challenges such as regulatory scrutiny in some regions, Floki's commitment to real utility and global philanthropy has kept investors interested.</p> <h3 dir="ltr">Bonk (BONK)</h3> <p dir="ltr">Bonk is the first "dog" meme coin created on the Solana blockchain. Exactly half of the initial issuance was distributed to the community via an airdrop, a move aimed at supporting the Solana ecosystem following a sharp decline in the token's value. Indeed, the introduction of <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bonk" target="_blank">BONK</a> sparked activity within the ecosystem, leading to new meme tokens, <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/learn/coin-burn-crypto" target="_blank">token burn</a> events, the creation of NFT collections, and more. </p> <div dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size:11px;"><img alt="Bonk" loading="lazy" src="https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/10156/content_Bonk.webp" style="width: 200px; height: 200px;"><br> Bonk (BONK)</span></div> <p dir="ltr">BONK's tokenomics include a massive 100 trillion token hoard, a significant portion of which is dedicated to supporting the Solana ecosystem, including NFT projects, DeFi users, and developers. </p> <p dir="ltr">In 2024, most major meme coins have ridden the wave of Bitcoin's momentum, but their gains have been much larger. For example, while Bitcoin rose 71% from the first of February to a new record high of $73,589 on 14 March, BONK rose 254% from 1 February to 5 March.</p> <h2 dir="ltr">The Bad and the Ugly</h2> <p dir="ltr">Having considered “the good” and “the bad” examples of meme coins, FBS analysts suggest delving into the behavior of dodgy meme coins like WSB Coin (WSB), SafeMoon, and BULL. They shed light on the prevalence of fraudulent projects within this realm. Such cautionary tales serve as a stark reminder of the importance of conducting thorough research and due diligence before venturing into the volatile world of cryptocurrency investment.</p> <h3 dir="ltr">WSB Coin (WSB)</h3> <p dir="ltr">A notorious meme coin scam recently unfolded involving a moderator from the popular trading subreddit r/WallStreetBets. The group introduced a meme coin dubbed WSB Coin (WSB), claiming it as the official meme coin of Wall Street Bets, and launched it on May 2. Promoters of the WSB token pledged to reserve 10% of the coins for the subreddit, with no allocation for the development team. However, just two days later, a moderator allegedly <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/wallstreetbets-mod-dumps-meme-coin-worth-635k-in-alleged-rug-pull" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">dumped</a> the allocated tokens on the market, resulting in a staggering decline in the token's value.</p> <div dir="ltr"><span style="font-size:11px;"><img alt="WSB" loading="lazy" src="https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/10166/content_WSB.webp" style="width: 1200px; height: 717px;"></span></div> <div dir="ltr"><span style="font-size:11px;">WSB Coin (WSB) chart</span></div> <div dir="ltr"> </div> <h3 dir="ltr">SafeMoon </h3> <div dir="ltr">Another notable case is <a href="https://twitter.com/SECGov/status/1719798312608354758?" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">SafeMoon</a>, which initially garnered substantial attention within the crypto community. Yet, it later faced accusations of being a scam due to dubious tokenomics and a lack of transparency from its development team.<span style="font-size:11px;"><img alt="SafeMoon" loading="lazy" src="https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/10167/content_Safemoon.webp" style="width: 1200px; height: 669px;"></span> </div> <div dir="ltr"><span style="font-size:11px;">SafeMoon chart</span></div> <div dir="ltr"> </div> <h3 dir="ltr">BULL token</h3> <p>The cryptocurrency community was rocked by a recent scam uncovered by ZachXBT, a renowned chain detector. The scheme involved an imposter posing as Ansem, who deceitfully promoted a fake presale of "BULL" tokens in the comments section of legitimate posts by the real Ansem. This duplicitous tactic led to substantial financial losses, with one <a href="https://coinpedia.org/news/crypto-imposter-swindles-over-2-6-million-amid-rising-memecoins-scam/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">unfortunate victim reportedly losing $1.2 million</a>. Despite ZachXBT's efforts to warn others, the scammers brazenly siphoned an additional $250,000 from unsuspecting individuals shortly after the initial alert. The scam persisted across multiple accounts, preying on innocent investors and illicitly profiting from the frenzy surrounding meme coins. The scammers took advantage of the hype around meme coins and tricked people into buying a non-existent BULL token.</p> <h2 dir="ltr">The Future of Meme Coins</h2> <p dir="ltr">The trajectory of meme coins appears uncertain yet intriguing, influenced by market trends, regulatory shifts, and investor sentiment. As cryptocurrencies gain mainstream traction, meme coins benefit from heightened interest but face challenges due to their speculative nature.</p> <p dir="ltr">FBS analysts underscore that community strength and ecosystem development are pivotal in determining a meme coin's longevity, while evolving regulatory landscapes pose potential obstacles. Despite uncertainties, meme coins remain attractive to high-risk investors.</p> <h3 dir="ltr">Doland Tremp (TREMP) and Jeo Boden (BODEN)</h3> <p dir="ltr">External events, such as the upcoming US presidential election, could fuel the hype around meme coins associated with the names of candidates, opening up speculative opportunities. For example, investors may focus on tokens such as <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/doland-tremp" target="_blank">Doland Tremp (TREMP)</a> and <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/jeo-boden" target="_blank">Jeo Boden (BODEN)</a>. Considering that these crypto assets are created based on the popular and rapidly developing Solana network, they also represent interesting investments, given their low capitalization.</p> <div dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;"> <span style="font-size:11px;"><img alt="TREMP and BODEN" loading="lazy" src="https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/10172/content_TREMP_and_BODEN.webp" style="width: 418px; height: 200px;"><br> Doland Tremp (TREMP) and Jeo Boden (BODEN) tokens</span><br>  </div> <h3 dir="ltr">Dogwifhat (WIF)</h3> <p dir="ltr">An interesting coin to consider is <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/dogwifhat" target="_blank">Dogwifhat (WIF)</a>. It has become one of the most prominent coins on Solana and recently became the third largest meme coin by market capitalization, overtaking Pepe (PEPE) on March 29.</p> <p dir="ltr">Backed by a community dedicated to the project's development, WIF has attracted attention as a cryptocurrency worth following. In particular, the community offered to place the project's logo on the Las Vegas sphere and initiated a donation link that raised $650,000.</p> <div dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;"> <span style="font-size:11px;"><img alt="Dogwifhat (WIF)" loading="lazy" src="https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/10170/content_Dogwifhat_%28WIF%29.webp" style="width: 200px; height: 200px;"><br> Dogwifhat (WIF)</span><br>  </div> <h3 dir="ltr">Book of Memes (BOME)</h3> <p dir="ltr">Also, an interesting coin to consider is <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/book-of-meme" target="_blank">Book of Memes (BOME)</a>, the latest Solana-based meme coin developed by mysterious crypto artist Darksfarm1 on X. BOME aims to revolutionize Web3 culture through decentralized storage and trading of memes, preserving them as part of our digital heritage.</p> <p dir="ltr">Launched on Binance at $0.00005, BOME has risen over 57,000% in three days, reaching an ATH of $0.0286. It's been quite a whirlwind, with a market value of over $1.5 billion. BOME is currently at $0.01171, and its volatility highlights the excitement and difficulty of trading new tokens.</p> <div dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;"> <span style="font-size:11px;"><img alt="Book of Memes (BOME)" loading="lazy" src="https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/10171/content_Book_of_Memes_%28BOME%29.webp" style="width: 200px; height: 200px;"><br> Book of Memes (BOME)</span><br>  </div> <h2 dir="ltr">Takeaways From FBS Analysts</h2> <p dir="ltr">Despite the hype surrounding meme coins, it is important to recognize their unpredictability and high risk. In the last month alone, 12 of the 27 meme coins launched on Solana were abandoned after pre-sale, resulting in users losing 180,650 SOL ($26.7 million). Shockingly, one of the projects didn't even have time to acquire a name before its demise.</p> <p dir="ltr">While meme coins are promising, prudent investors must first be informed, conduct thorough due diligence, and cautiously approach the volatile market landscape. </p> <p dir="ltr">Predicting which meme coins will experience an upward or downward movement is virtually impossible. However, the prevailing view is that meme coins are gaining a significant share of the gains, while fundamentally strong coins are experiencing comparatively smaller gains. These dynamics offer potentially favorable investment prospects for those willing to accept the higher risk of investing in meme coins.</p> <p dir="ltr">In summary, investing in meme coins demands caution and thorough research. While some projects may hold potential for growth and community-driven value, others have fallen victim to scams or rapid depreciation. It's vital for investors to stay informed about market trends and regulatory changes and to exercise prudent risk management practices. While meme coins offer speculative opportunities, readers are urged to approach cautiously, prioritize transparency, and practice diligence in their crypto investments.</p> <hr> <p dir="ltr"><strong>About FBS</strong></p> <p dir="ltr"><a href="https://fbs.com/?utm_source=finanalysts&amp;utm_medium=coingecko&amp;utm_campaign=memecoins" target="_blank">FBS</a> is a licensed global broker with over 15 years of experience and more than 90 international awards.

<title>What Is MEV (Maximal Extractable Value) in Crypto?</title>
<content type="html"><h2 dir="ltr">What Is MEV?</h2> <p dir="ltr">Maximal extractable value, popularly known as MEV, refers to the maximum value miners or network validators can extract by rearranging and reordering transactions waiting to be added to the blockchain.</p> <hr> <h3 dir="ltr">Key Takeaways</h3> <ul> <li aria-level="1" dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr" role="presentation">MEV is the maximum amount of value miners or network validators can extract by rearranging and reordering transactions waiting for confirmation.</p> </li> <li aria-level="1" dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr" role="presentation">It is commonly referred to as the “invisible tax” miners collect from other participants in the cryptocurrency market.</p> </li> <li aria-level="1" dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr" role="presentation">MEV is a prominent phenomenon on Ethereum. However, it is not unique to the smart contract platform.</p> </li> <li aria-level="1" dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr" role="presentation">This article explains the maximal extractable value phenomenon, how it impacts the crypto industry, and how to avoid it.</p> </li> </ul> <hr> <div dir="ltr"><img alt="What is MEV crypto" src="https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/10157/content_What_is_MEV_crypto.webp" style="width: 1200px; height: 600px;"></div> <p dir="ltr">The MEV phenomenon was first highlighted in 2014 by a pseudonymous algorithmic trader, Pmcgoohan, who predicted that miners might be able to manipulate the transactions in the validation process to generate a profit. “Miners can see all the contract code they run (obviously) and the order in which transactions run is up to individual miners. What is to stop front running by a miner in any marketplace implementation by Ethereum?”, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/2d84yv/miners_frontrunning/?rdt=33132" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">they wrote in a post</a> on Reddit.</p> <p dir="ltr">However, the MEV term was not coined until 2019 when Phil Daian and other smart contract researchers wrote a paper titled “Flash Boys 2.0”. In the <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.05234.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2019 research paper</a>, the term denoted miner extractable value, which Daian and his colleagues defined as the total amount of ETH miners can extract from reordering transactions within a given block.</p> <p dir="ltr">In 2022, following Ethereum’s transition from the Proof-of-Work (PoW) to a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, the MEV term changed to “maximal extractable value” to represent a broader range of techniques to extract value from users. It is worth noting that while the MEV phenomenon is most prominent on the Ethereum network, it is also common on other blockchains.</p> <h2 dir="ltr">How Does MEV Work?</h2> <p dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.coingecko.com/research/publications/the-beginner-s-guide-to-mev">Maximal extractable value (MEV)</a> is possible due to the decentralized nature of blockchain technology and the cryptocurrency industry. Contrary to the traditional finance world, where transaction orders are rigidly enforced, crypto miners and validators can reorder and sequence a set of transactions as they wish within a given block.</p> <p dir="ltr">In the decentralized cryptocurrency system – both the PoW and PoS <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/learn/coingecko-consensus-algorithms-guide-part-1" target="_blank">consensus mechanisms</a>, pending transactions are temporarily sent to and held in the blockchain’s mempool, a publicly accessible waiting area. The transactions in this mempool are selected by miners or network validators, who then sequence order them to create a block that is then verified and added to the blockchain. In theory, miners/validators should simply prioritize processing transactions by gas fees; however, because of the transparency of the mempool, it gives rise to other more profitable opportunities to extract value, such as arbitrage, sandwich attacks, and liquidations.</p> <p dir="ltr">On paper, miners and validators should receive the maximal extractable value since they are responsible for the execution and, ultimately, the success of MEV extraction. However, in actual practice, MEV extraction is mainly carried out by independent network participants known as “searchers,” who use complex algorithms and bots to detect MEV opportunities and generate profit.</p> <p dir="ltr">In the most common MEV types, these searchers pay high gas fees to incentivize the miners or validators to include their transactions in target blocks in order to derive additional value. The gas fees often serve as incentives and as the portion of the maximal extractable value that goes to the miners and validators. In recent times we have even seen searchers partner directly with miners / validators for MEV extraction. </p> <style type="text/css">.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; } </style> <div class="embed-container"><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/u4sV-Btg1Ag"></iframe></div> <h2 dir="ltr">Types of MEV</h2> <p dir="ltr">To fully understand the concept of MEV, it is essential to discuss the different ways through which these searchers generate additional value in the market. Below, we will dive into details of the different MEV types in the current crypto landscape.</p> <h3 dir="ltr">DEX Arbitrage</h3> <p dir="ltr">In the traditional financial system, arbitrage takes advantage of a difference in an asset’s price across different trading venues. Similarly, arbitrage-based MEV extraction takes advantage of price discrepancies of tokens across various decentralized exchanges (DEXs).</p> <p dir="ltr">In this MEV type, searchers generate additional value by purchasing tokens at a lower price on one exchange to sell them on another exchange at a higher value. They also derive a profit by taking advantage of any price discrepancies across different <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/learn/liquidity-pools-crypto-defi" target="_blank">liquidity pools</a> on the same exchange.</p> <p dir="ltr">Here’s a scenario – let’s assume the exchange rates of BUSD/SOL in two separate liquidity pools (LP1 and LP2) on PancakeSwap V2 are 143 BUSD and 146 BUSD for 1 SOL, respectively. </p> <p dir="ltr">A searcher can take advantage of the arbitrage opportunity within the same block itself by injecting the following transactions into the block;</p> <ol> <li aria-level="1" dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Sell 50 SOL in LP2 and receive 7,300 BUSD.</p> </li> <li aria-level="1" dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Sell 7,300 BUSD in LP1 and receive 51.05 SOL.</p> </li> </ol> <p dir="ltr">From the example above, the searcher generates a profit of 1.05 SOL (excluding the transaction costs for the two transactions). While it might seem like an unfair advantage, arbitrage helps to improve DeFi market efficiency by ensuring token prices are aligned across different exchanges.</p> <h3 dir="ltr">Liquidations</h3> <p dir="ltr">In decentralized finance, <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/learn/defi-liquidation-crypto" target="_blank">liquidation</a> is a process that occurs when the value of a borrower’s collateral does not cover the value of their loan or debt. Once a debt is liquidated, any individual can purchase the original collateral at a discount and resell the asset at a higher price to make a profit.</p> <p dir="ltr">In this MEV type, searchers act as liquidators who scan the blockchain for unhealthy loan positions that need to be liquidated. These individuals identify loan positions that are eligible for liquidation, acquire the borrowers’ collaterals at a discounted price, and resell at a higher price to gain extra value.</p> <p dir="ltr">Indeed, this type of MEV is often neutral and non-harmful because liquidations are a regular occurrence in any financial system that allows buying and borrowing. However, liquidations can sometimes be malicious and are referred to as “toxic liquidations.”</p> <h2 dir="ltr">Sandwich Attacks</h2> <p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.coingecko.com/learn/sandwich-attacks-prevention-crypto" target="_blank">Sandwich attacks</a> are a malicious type of MEV, where the searcher executes a transaction ahead of an initially identified trade (front-running) and follows the target transaction with another trade (back-running). This strategy is often employed to take advantage of large orders that cause the price of assets to fluctuate.</p> <p dir="ltr">Here's a simple breakdown of a sandwich attack;</p> <ol> <li aria-level="1" dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr" role="presentation">MEV searcher executes a buy order, driving up the asset’s price.</p> </li> <li aria-level="1" dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr" role="presentation">MEV target purchases the asset at a higher price.</p> </li> <li aria-level="1" dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr" role="presentation">MEV searcher sells the asset at the higher price, gaining a profit from the price difference</p> </li> </ol> <h3 dir="ltr">Front-running</h3> <p dir="ltr">Front-running is the first phase in a sandwich attack, which involves searching through a blockchain’s mempool for pending transactions that could impact a specific asset’s price and from which they can extract significant value. For instance, if a frontrunner – often a sophisticated bot –- detects a large buy order for a specific cryptocurrency, they recognize that this transaction could drive the token’s value higher once confirmed.</p> <p dir="ltr">The bot will then create a buy order for the same token, to get their transaction processed before the target transaction. They assign a higher gas price to their transaction, incentivizing the validator to prioritize their buy order over the initially detected transaction.</p> <h3 dir="ltr">Back-running</h3> <p dir="ltr">To complete the sandwich attack, the bot also creates a sell order, intending to have it executed right after the target transaction, thereby selling the asset at a higher price. This strategy is known as back-running, and it is accomplished by assigning a lower gas price to the second trade to ensure that it is validated after the target transaction. </p> <p dir="ltr">Ultimately, this type of MEV will reduce the value the targeted traders would have otherwise gained from their transactions. Meanwhile, the searcher benefits from the price fluctuations triggered by the target transaction.</p> <h2 dir="ltr">MEV Attacks and How to Avoid Them</h2> <p dir="ltr">Having gone through the various types of MEV, it is clear how MEV attacks may significantly affect participants on a blockchain network, particularly the decentralized finance space. Below are some of the countermeasures to avoid falling victim to MEV attacks.</p> <ol> <li aria-level="1" dir="ltr"> <h3 dir="ltr" role="presentation">RPC Endpoints (MEV Blockers)</h3> </li> </ol> <p dir="ltr">MEV blockers are software tools that protect users from MEV exploitation. Since MEV extraction relies on rearranging transactions in a new and profitable order, it is possible to avoid this manipulation by submitting transactions to a specialized network of searchers bound by specific rules that ensure favorable execution for users.</p> <p dir="ltr">MEV blockers operate through <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/learn/crypto-rpc-best-rpc-providers" target="_blank">RPC (Remote Procedure Call) endpoints</a>, a communication protocol between the blockchain and a user’s wallet. RPC endpoints safely reroute towards the aforementioned network of searchers rather than sending transactions to the publicly visible mempool where malicious searchers are waiting to strike.</p> <p dir="ltr">The specialized network of searchers commits to not front-run or sandwich users’ transactions. Contrarily, they even extract value and put money back into the users’ pockets by back-running large transactions and returning a large portion of the gains. </p> <ol start="2"> <li aria-level="1" dir="ltr"> <h3 dir="ltr" role="presentation">Lower Slippage Tolerance</h3> </li> </ol> <p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.coingecko.com/learn/slippage-crypto" target="_blank">Slippage</a> is defined as the difference between the intended execution price of a transaction and the actual execution price of the transaction. This often occurs in crypto due to the volatile nature of the market, and it accounts for why some MEV attacks are possible.</p> <p dir="ltr">A slippage tolerance allows the execution of a transaction only if the token price remains within the set range. Setting a lower slippage tolerance can help protect users against sandwich attacks and limit unexpected losses.</p> <p dir="ltr">Here’s an example – an exploiter places a large order ahead of a trader’s transaction, which triggers a significant shift in the token price. If this price change exceeds the trader’s slippage tolerance, their transaction will get canceled.</p> <ol start="3"> <li aria-level="1" dir="ltr"> <h3 dir="ltr" role="presentation">Priority Gas Fees</h3> </li> </ol> <p dir="ltr">Although selecting lower gas fees for transactions is the most economical option, there is the risk that the transactions may be processed slowly and discovered by malicious actors. Hence, traders should consider paying priority gas fees for their transactions, especially large amounts, in order to avoid falling victim to MEV attacks. </p> <p dir="ltr">Miners or validators will prioritize and process a transaction with a higher gas fee, and attackers will need to assign an even higher fee to front-run such a transaction. Ultimately, the steep price and cost-reward ratio may discourage most searchers from targeting the transaction.</p> <ol start="4"> <li aria-level="1" dir="ltr"> <h3 dir="ltr" role="presentation">DEX-Native MEV Protection</h3> </li> </ol> <p dir="ltr">Traders can protect themselves from MEV exploits by utilizing <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/learn/what-is-a-decentralized-crypto-exchange-dex" target="_blank">DEXs</a> or dApps designed to mitigate the impacts of MEV. CoW Protocol, for instance, is a DEX aggregator that employs batch auctions and intents as its trading mechanism to produce favorable results for users.</p> <p dir="ltr">A batch auction is a type of trading mechanism that collects orders together in batches and “auctions” them to execution parties (also known as solvers) who compete with each other to find the most optimal order settlement paths. This technique enforces specific execution rules that prevent MEV exploits.</p> <h2 dir="ltr">MEV on Solana vs. MEV on Ethereum</h2> <p dir="ltr">Although MEV and MEV-related exploits are most popular on the Ethereum network, they are not restricted to the smart contract platform. Maximal extractable value is a common phenomenon on other blockchains and smart contract platforms, such as Solana. However, there are different manifestations of MEV on these blockchains due to their unique designs and consensus mechanisms.</p> <p dir="ltr">Here, we'll look at how the maximal extractable value on Ethereum compares to that on Solana under the following topics.</p> <ol> <li aria-level="1" dir="ltr"> <h3 dir="ltr" role="presentation">Consensus Mechanism</h3> </li> </ol> <p dir="ltr">Ethereum network is a proof-of-stake network. Solana, on the other hand, operates on a unique combination of Proof-of-History (PoH) and delegated Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanisms. This forms the foundation of the differences between both blockchains in terms of MEV extraction.</p> <p dir="ltr">For instance, Solana’s PoH mechanism operates by establishing a trustless and verifiable order of transactions on the blockchain. The chronological nature of this consensus algorithm makes it difficult to rearrange or manipulate transactions in order to gain additional value, as in the case of front-running attacks.</p> <ol start="2"> <li aria-level="1" dir="ltr"> <h3 dir="ltr" role="presentation">Network Infrastructure</h3> </li> </ol> <p dir="ltr">The difference in the design of Solana and Ethereum provides another point of comparison between both networks in terms of MEV. There are certain features that make users of either blockchain vulnerable to MEV-related exploits.</p> <p dir="ltr">For instance, unlike Ethereum’s, the Solana infrastructure does not have a publicly visible mempool, where transactions wait for validation. This means that searchers can’t target individual transactions, reducing the possibility of sandwich attacks and front-running transactions.</p> <p dir="ltr">Solana is a <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/learn/most-popular-cryptocurrencies" target="_blank">Layer 1 blockchain</a>, which, upon launch, was dubbed the “Ethereum Killer” because of its relatively higher speed and better energy efficiency. As a result of its high throughput and low latency, transactions are processed quickly and in large volumes, limiting the window of opportunity for MEV exploits.</p> <p dir="ltr">What’s more, transaction fees on Solana are virtually nonexistent compared to Ethereum. With the negligible costs of most transactions, it is challenging to engage in MEV practices that rely on gas wars for favorable placement. If a searcher can not push their order ahead of a target transaction by assigning a higher gas fee, then the possibility of front-running such a transaction is close to zero.</p> <p dir="ltr">However, Solana is more susceptible to MEV NFT bots, where bots swarm the NFT minting program with mint requests to get as many NFTs as possible upon launch and resell them immediately. This is possible due to the low transaction gas fees on Solana, with the effect of impacting the NFT market and also congests the network. Proposed solutions include a “tax” for invalid transaction and dynamic pricing for popular NFTs. </p> <h2 dir="ltr">Final Thoughts</h2> <p dir="ltr">Maximal extractable value is a phenomenon in the crypto space that has continued to evolve over the years. Understanding the distinct techniques of MEV on different blockchain platforms is essential to adapt to the evolving risks and avoid becoming unwilling victims of such exploits.</p> <p dir="ltr">As addressed in this article, there are different individual-based strategies and protocol-level methods for protection against MEV-related activities. While some cases of MEV extractions are deemed malicious, there are still some advantages attached to having such activities in the cryptocurrency market.</p> <p dir="ltr">Some MEV strategies, such as arbitrage, help to enhance efficiency in the cryptocurrency market by ensuring the alignment of prices across various exchanges. All in all, maximal extractable value is a hot and complex topic that requires much more in-depth research for a better understanding.</p> </content>

With the possibility for so many accounts and positions, consolidating your investments to find out your overall return is difficult. Additionally, crypto tax regulation can vary across countries, adding to the complexity of determining your taxable income.</p> <p>In today’s article we will cover the basics of crypto taxes, before building our own basic template using a specific accounting method and <a href="http://www.coingecko.com/en/api?utm_campaign=learn&amp;utm_content=crypto-tax-calculator-excel-template" target="_blank">CoinGecko API</a>. Let's dive in!</p> <p><img alt="Download free crypto tax calculator excel template" src="https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/9921/content_Free_Crypto_Tax_Calculator_Excel_Template.webp" style="width: 1200px; height: 597px;"></p> <h2>Crypto Taxes: How Much Tax Will I Pay on Crypto?</h2> <p dir="ltr" role="presentation">If your job pays you in cryptocurrency, you will pay ordinary income tax which varies depending on your region and tax bracket. However, if you dispose of your crypto holdings, this can be considered a short-term or long-term capital gains tax, contingent on the time you have held the asset for.</p> <p dir="ltr" role="presentation">If you have held this cryptocurrency for more than a year, you will be subject to long-term capital gains tax (0%-20% in the US).</p> <p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Alternatively, if you have held your cryptocurrency for less than a year, you will be subject to short-term capital gains tax, which is treated the same as ordinary income, taxed between 10% and 37% depending on your bracket.</p> <h3 dir="ltr" role="presentation">How to Calculate your Capital Gains and Losses</h3> <p dir="ltr" role="presentation">To calculate your capital gains, you would first need to determine your cost basis. Put simply, this is the original price you paid for an asset. Your cost basis is pertinent to calculate the profit you achieved from conducting any transaction: selling, swapping, or being airdropped any crypto assets, for example, fall within taxable transactions. Therefore, the cost basis is the original price plus any related transaction fees.</p> <p dir="ltr" role="presentation">For example, if you bought ETH for $2,000, and you paid 0.25% in gas fees ($5), your cost basis would be $2,005. If you later sell this ETH for $3,000, paying a 0.05% gas fee ($15), your cost basis is now $2,020.</p> <p dir="ltr" role="presentation">To calculate your capital gains or losses you simply subtract your cost basis from the sale price, and, in this example, your capital gain would be $3,000 - $2,020 = $980. You made a capital gain of $980, which you will need to pay Capital Gains Tax on.</p> <p dir="ltr" role="presentation">There are a number of different cost basis methods used in accounting. Depending on the country in which you pay taxes you may even be entitled to select your chosen method, as in the United States. Provided you can identify the specific asset you are disposing of, the <a href="https://www.irs.gov/instructions/i1040sd#idm139954622505344" target="_blank">IRS</a> states you can select your chosen cost basis method, such as HIFO, FIFO, or LIFO. Whatever method you choose, you must use it consistently when calculating your gains or losses. If you are uncertain as to which cost basis method you can use, contact the IRS to confirm.</p> <p dir="ltr" role="presentation">If we return to our earlier example, we can see how our capital gains or losses vary depending on the chosen method. Lets assume our transaction history includes 1 ETH bought  in 2021 for $2100, 1 ETH bought later in 2021 for $4100, and 1 ETH bought in 2023 for $1800, and 1 ETH sold in 2023 for $2200. If we went by the First in, First out (FIFO) method our capital gains would be $2200-2100 = $100. If we used Last in, First out (LIFO) our capital gains would be $2200-$1800 = $400. Lastly, if we use Highest in, First out (HIFO) our capital losses would be $2200-$4100 = -$1300. Every transaction fee involved in moving, swapping, or sending out cryptocurrency can also be added to our cost basis, lowering the capital gains.</p> <p dir="ltr">FIFO is the most common accounting method used by investors to calculate their capital gains. If the price of crypto has dropped since you first bought it, this method can lower your capital gains tax. Additionally, as FIFO disposes of your longest-held cryptocurrency, depending on your situation, you can take advantage of a lower long-term capital gains tax.</p> <p dir="ltr"><em>Disclaimer: Ensure the template is compatible with the tax laws in each country where you have a tax obligation. This may require some customization or modification of the template. Our template has been made specifically to cater to US tax laws.</em></p> <h3>How to Calculate Your Adjusted Cost Basis (ACB)</h3> <p dir="ltr">The adjusted cost basis is the consolidation of the cost of any asset and any related fees. This method is applicable to the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/programs/about-canada-revenue-agency-cra/compliance/digital-currency/cryptocurrency-guide.html" target="_blank">Canadian Revenue Agency</a>.  You can either use the fair market value (FMV) of the cryptocurrency at the end of the year, or when you acquired it, depending on which is lower. Additionally, they require the following to be recorded:</p> <ul dir="ltr"> <li role="presentation">Date and time of each transaction</li> <li role="presentation">Value of the crypto-asset in CAD</li> <li role="presentation">Number of units and type of cryptocurrency</li> <li role="presentation">The addresses associated with each digital wallet used</li> <li role="presentation">The beginning and end wallet balance for each crypto-asset for each year </li> </ul> <p>If you hold an array of assets, you can choose to use the FMV for your entire portfolio at the end of the year. Alternatively, you could choose the exchange rate shown by the same exchange broker you used or an average of their high/low/open/close across a number of brokers. Preferably, you could use an aggregated price across all exchanges for your cryptocurrencies – as offered by <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/api?utm_campaign=learn&amp;utm_content=crypto-tax-calculator-excel-template" target="_blank">CoinGecko API</a>.</p> <hr> <h2>Prerequisites</h2> <p dir="ltr">To build our Tax Calculator, we will use <strong>Microsoft Excel 365</strong> and the<strong> Virtual Basic for Applications (VBA)</strong> language.</p> <p dir="ltr">Ensure you also have access to the<strong> <a href="http://www.coingecko.com/en/api/pricing?utm_campaign=learn&amp;utm_content=crypto-tax-calculator-excel-template">CoinGecko Demo API</a></strong>.

Setting it to false allows for our code execution to be one line at a time, making the code wait until the request is complete before moving on to the next line.</p> </li> </ol> <p dir="ltr"><code>        ' Check if the request was successful (status code 200)<br>         If http.Status = 200 Then<br>             ' Store the JSON response text<br>             JSONResponseText = http.responseText<br>             <br>             ' Extract the USD price from the JSON response<br>             Dim startIdx As Long<br>             Dim endIdx As Long<br>             startIdx = InStr(JSONResponseText, """usd"":") + Len("""usd"":")<br>             endIdx = InStr(startIdx, JSONResponseText, ",")<br>             <br>             If startIdx &gt; 0 And endIdx &gt; startIdx Then<br>                 Dim usdPrice As Variant<br>                 usdPrice = Mid(JSONResponseText, startIdx, endIdx - startIdx)<br>                 <br>                 ' Return the extracted USD price<br>                 GetCryptoPrice = usdPrice<br>                 Exit Function</code></p> <ol start="6"> <li aria-level="1" dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>Extracting the USD price from the JSON response: </strong>If the request is successful (status code 200), it extracts the USD price from the JSON response and returns it through these steps:  </p> </li> </ol> <ul dir="ltr"> <li role="presentation"> <strong><code>JSONResponseText = http.responseText:</code></strong> This line assigns the response text from the HTTP request to the variable JSONResponseText. http.responseText contains the entire response received from the server in the form of a string, which, in our case, includes the price of our chosen cryptocurrency in relation to a number of fiat currencies: CAD, GBP, USD, etc. For our purposes, we only desire the price in relation to one currency: USD.</li> <li role="presentation"> <strong><code>startIdx = InStr(JSONResponseText, """usd"":") + Len("""usd"":"):</code> </strong>Here, InStr function is used to find the position of the first occurrence of the substring """usd"":" within the JSONResponseText string.

Simply save the module using the ‘Save’ button in the Visual Basic Editor and go to a sheet in excel. For example, you can type ‘ethereum’ in cell A15, ‘30-06-2021’ in cell B15 (ensure date is of the form dd-mm-yyyy to avoid issues with the API request), and type ‘<tt>=Module1.GetCryptoPrice(A15,B15)</tt>’ into cell C15 to retrieve the price of ethereum on that day!</p> <h3>Step 2: Getting our Transaction History &amp; Template</h3> <p dir="ltr">The complexity of accessing your transaction history varies depending on your chosen wallet. Assuming we use Metamask, open your wallet, select your chosen network (e.g. Ethereum mainnet), and hit the three dots in the top right, and select ‘View on Explorer’. In this instance, this will take you to Etherscan where you can download a CSV of your transaction history in the bottom right, underneath your transactions.</p> <p dir="ltr">Now we will use the dates of our transactions, Value_IN(ETH), Value_OUT(ETH), potentially contract addresses and methods, and TxnFee (USD). We will build a tax calculator over the period of January 1st, 2021 to December 31st, 2021 in this example. Now, if we return to our excel sheet we can set up our table like so:</p> <p><img alt="How to calculate crypto taxes in Excel - evaluate Capital Gains under FIFO" loading="lazy" src="https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/9917/content_Screenshot_2024-04-08_at_5.52.03%E2%80%AFPM.webp" style="width: 1200px; height: 469px;"></p> <p dir="ltr">As shown above, we will take the date of our transactions from our csv Etherscan file and place it into column C, alongside the Value_IN under purchased assets, and the Value_OUT, in sold assets. We will convert our date stamps into the form “dd-mm-yyy”, so it is an appropriate input for our function, by using:</p> <ul> <li aria-level="1" dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><code>=TEXT(B19,"dd-mm-yyyy")</code></p> </li> </ul> <p dir="ltr">Next we can use our function to draw price data as we have done before, simply type:</p> <ul> <li aria-level="1" dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><tt>=Module1.GetCryptoPrice</tt> (ensure “ethereum” or the properly typed coin id is next to it)</p> </li> </ul> <p dir="ltr">We can multiply our Value_IN column by these prices to determine what our Value_IN in USD was (Column F above). We then include our transaction fees in the column next to that.</p> <p dir="ltr">Repeat the same process for sold assets, but multiply Value_OUT by Price on Date to find the Price on Date for that column in USD.</p> <h3>Step 3: Determine Capital Gains with FIFO Accounting Method</h3> <p dir="ltr">We will use the “FIFO” accounting method to determine our capital gains. To do this we will make two columns to the right of our Transaction Fee column: Quantity Sold and Cost of Assets Sold (COAS is an arbitrary name). Assuming we sell the crypto we purchased first, our FIRST cell of our quantity sold is calculated by using the formula:</p> <ul> <li aria-level="1" dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><code>= min(amount in corresponding Value_IN column, sum of Value_OUT column in sold assets)</code></p> </li> </ul> <p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><img alt="" loading="lazy" src="https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/9918/content_Screenshot_2024-04-08_at_5.50.44%E2%80%AFPM.webp" style="width: 1200px; height: 263px;"></p> <p dir="ltr" role="presentation">The following cells in this column will minimize either the corresponding Value_IN, or the sum of the sold assets subtracted by a running total of previously sold Ethereum:</p> <p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><img alt="calculating crypto taxes on excel spreadsheet" loading="lazy" src="https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/9919/content_Screenshot_2024-04-08_at_5.51.27%E2%80%AFPM.webp" style="width: 1200px; height: 250px;"></p> <p dir="ltr">At the bottom, you can notice our Quantity Sold is equivalent to the Sum of our Value_OUT. This helps us calculate our cost basis (COAS): multiply the quantity sold by the price on that day and add the transaction fee:</p> <ul> <li aria-level="1" dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><code>=(H19*D19)+G19</code></p> </li> </ul> <p dir="ltr">Consolidating this column gives us our cost basis and allows us to calculate our capital gains/losses:</p> <p><img alt="Derive cost basis and calculate our capital gains and losses on crypto investments" loading="lazy" src="https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/9920/content_Screenshot_2024-04-08_at_5.52.03%E2%80%AFPM.webp" style="width: 1200px; height: 469px;"></p> <p dir="ltr">However, we still need to determine if any assets have been held for longer than a year, and, subsequently, if we are entitled to a long-term capital gains tax. To do this we can use the following formula to find any dates that precede our chosen time horizon (in this case January 1st, 2021 to December 31st, 2021):</p> <ul> <li aria-level="1" dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><code>=IF(SUM((B19:B34&lt;B4)*(F19:F34)), SUMIFS(F19:F34, B19:B34, "&lt;=" &amp; B4, A19:A34, "ethereum"), 0)</code></p> </li> </ul> <p>This isolates any dates before January 1st 2021, highlighting any long-term assets. Following the summation of the Value (In USD) on these older dates, our result is included in the long-term capital gains cell. Our short-term capital gains is thus the difference between our total and long-term.</p> <p>You can determine which tax bracket you fall into in the table included below that.</p> <h2>Download the Free Crypto Tax Calculator Excel Template</h2> <p>Instead of building your own crypto tax calculator in Excel, simply enter your email below to download our free crypto tax calculator template – so you can start calculating your taxes today!</p> <getresponse-form e="1" form-id="5b1dd4cf-1bf0-407a-88c3-dc3bbba1c2d5"></getresponse-form> <p> </p> <h3>Updating Coin Names in Your Excel Calculator</h3> <p>To add a different cryptocurrency, reference <a href="https://docs.coingecko.com/v3.0.1/reference/coins-list?utm_campaign=learn&amp;utm_content=crypto-tax-calculator-excel-template" target="_blank">Coins List</a> on the API documentation, or find it <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wTTuxXt8n9q7C4NDXqQpI3wpKu1_5bGVmP9Xz0XGSyU/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">here</a>.

<title>Swell Network Airdrop: Guide on How to Earn Pearls</title>
<content type="html"><h2 dir="ltr">How to Earn Pearls on Swell</h2> <p dir="ltr">Users can earn Pearls on Swell, an Ethereum staking protocol, through The Voyage program that involves providing liquidity on platforms like Balancer, Uniswap, and Pendle, and also by depositing on Swell and restaking ETH. Pearls can be exchanged for SWELL tokens at Swell's Token Generation Event. </p> <hr> <h3 dir="ltr">Key Takeaways</h3> <ul> <li aria-level="1" dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Swell Network is an Ethereum staking protocol that leverages EigenLayer to offer liquidity and rewards for staked ETH.</p> </li> <li aria-level="1" dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr" role="presentation">In a funding round led by Framework Ventures and IOSG Ventures, Swell Network successfully raised $3.75 million.</p> </li> <li aria-level="1" dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Users can now participate in Swell’s Voyage program to earn Pearls which can be exchanged for SWELL tokens in the future.</p> </li> </ul> <hr> <div dir="ltr"><img alt="Earn Pearls on Swell" src="https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/10148/content_Earn_Pearls_on_Swell.webp" style="width: 1200px; height: 600px;"></div> <p dir="ltr">Swell Network is a non-custodial decentralized <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/chains/ethereum" target="_blank">Ethereum</a> staking protocol that offers liquidity and reward incentives for staked <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum" target="_blank">ETH</a>. Users can earn passive income by depositing their ETH in exchange for the swETH token that represents the user’s staked ETH and can be traded or used in other DeFi applications. The protocol leverages <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/learn/eigenlayer-restaking-ethereum" target="_blank">EigenLayer</a> to distribute the staked ETH across a network of Actively Validated Secured Services (AVSs). By applying this restaking mechanism, users can still earn additional rewards on top of the usual Ethereum staking benefits. </p> <p dir="ltr">In efforts to prioritize transparency and security, Swell has integrated Chainlink Proof of Reserve, allowing users to verify in near real time that swETH is backed by ETH reserves on Ethereum’s Beacon chain. In addition, Swell also joined Chainlink’s BUILD program to further enhance its security and reliability by tapping on enhanced Chainlink services and technical support. </p> <p dir="ltr">The Swell Network also ensures the platform’s security by undergoing continuous audits conducted by blockchain security firms to identify and address vulnerabilities. When it comes to node operators, Swell vets through them to distinguish between verified operators who are either licensed or whitelisted and independent operators who are unlicensed. </p> <p dir="ltr">Users can also benefit from the many strategic partnerships that Swell has with notable projects such as <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethena" target="_blank">Ethena</a>, <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/learn/pendle" target="_blank">Pendle</a>, and EigenPie. These collaborations let users deposit various assets including <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethena-usde" target="_blank">Ethena USDe</a>, Pendle PT rswETH, and <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/eigenpie-wbeth" target="_blank">mwbETH</a>, and further diversifies the project’s offerings. On top of that, depositing in the Swell L2 Pre-Launch Deposit contract on mainnet gives users the opportunity to earn various points and be eligible for airdrop from both Swell and projects building on the <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/learn/what-are-layer-2-crypto-protocols" target="_blank">Layer 2</a>. These projects include ION Protocol, Ambient Finance, and Brahma Finance.</p> <p dir="ltr">Swell Network has raised a total of $3.75 million in a Seed round in March 2022. The funding round was led by Framework Ventures and supported by IOSG Ventures, Maven 11 Capital, and more. </p> <p dir="ltr">As part of its roadmap this year, Swell will launch its own native token, SWELL, which will be used for protocol <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/learn/governance-tokens" target="_blank">governance</a> and to incentivize growth on its platform. The final tokenomics have yet to be announced by the Swell team but it has been revealed that at least 7% of the supply is allocated for a token airdrop, with the total size potentially increasing as community bonus milestones are hit. </p> <p dir="ltr">Users can participate in The Voyage program which rewards users for their contributions with Pearls that can be exchanged for SWELL tokens at the Token Generation Event. On top of that, Swell will also airdrop SWELL tokens to all depositors on the launch of Swell L2 that is set to happen in Q3 2024. Do note that this is separate from the 7% of supply allocated to Pearl Holders. </p> <h2 dir="ltr">Step 1: Join Swell Voyage</h2> <p dir="ltr">Head over to <a href="https://app.swellnetwork.io/voyage" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://app.swellnetwork.io/voyage</a> and <strong>Connect wallet</strong> in the upper right corner. </p> <div dir="ltr"><img alt="Connect Wallet to Swell" loading="lazy" src="https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/10102/content_1._Connect_Wallet.webp" style="width: 1200px; height: 523px;"></div> <p dir="ltr">There are seven available wallets for you to choose from, and you can connect others through WalletConnect.

<content type="html"><h2 dir="ltr">What Is DeFi Saver?</h2> <p dir="ltr"><a href="https://defisaver.com/?utm_source=CoinGecko&amp;utm_medium=Website+article&amp;utm_campaign=DFS+explainer+article+-+Coingecko" target="_blank">DeFi Saver</a> is a one-stop platform for decentralized finance services. It provides a unified interface for a basket of DeFi protocols including top DEXs and lending protocols. </p> <hr> <h3 dir="ltr">Key Takeaways</h3> <ul> <li aria-level="1" dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr" role="presentation">DeFi Saver allows users to access the integrated protocols from a single platform, saving them the hassle of switching between applications and offering a better user experience for managing their positions.</p> </li> <li aria-level="1" dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr" role="presentation">It is also designed with additional features that enable users to operate with ease and achieve more with their assets, such as leverage management, automation and loan shifting between different protocols. </p> </li> <li aria-level="1" dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr" role="presentation">DeFi Saver’s DEX aggregator allows for advanced asset exchange transactions like limit orders and DCA.</p> </li> <li aria-level="1" dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Users can also use the simulation tool, as they can try out the protocols and DeFi Saver features, while simulating transactions before submitting them with real assets. </p> </li> <li aria-level="1" dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr" role="presentation">This article discusses the key features of the DeFi saver application and how users can operate on multiple DeFi protocols from a single interface.</p> </li> </ul> <hr> <div dir="ltr"><img alt="What is DeFi Saver?" src="https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/10146/content_DeFi_Saver.webp" style="width: 1200px; height: 628px;"></div> <p dir="ltr">DeFi allows users to maintain self-custody of their assets without requiring intermediaries like brokerages, centralized exchanges, or banks. At time of writing, the total value locked in DeFi is over $94 billion, with thousands of protocols across different blockchains. With so many protocols, users often have to switch between different frontends and interfaces as they manage their assets. </p> <p dir="ltr">This is where DeFi Saver comes in. DeFi Saver’s all-in-one DeFi management allows users to manage their assets and positions across multiple protocols and networks in a single interface. It also offers users a more powerful experience when interacting with protocols, by providing them with more options than they would have by using the UI of the particular protocol. </p> <div dir="ltr"><img alt="DeFi Saver Portfolio" loading="lazy" src="https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/10132/content_DeFi_Saver_Portfolio.webp" style="width: 1200px; height: 684px;"></div> <div dir="ltr"> </div> <h2 dir="ltr">Introduction to DeFi Saver</h2> <p dir="ltr"><a href="https://defisaver.com/?utm_source=CoinGecko&amp;utm_medium=Website+article&amp;utm_campaign=DFS+explainer+article+-+Coingecko" target="_blank">DeFi Saver</a><b> </b>is your one-stop platform for everything DeFi. It offers access to multiple decentralized finance applications through an interface where users can use these applications without going to their respective platforms. DeFi Saver currently supports a number of reputable DeFi protocols, such as Aave, MakerDAO, Spark, Compound, Reflexer, CurveUSD, Morpho Blue, and others. According to the project, more will be added in the future.</p> <p dir="ltr">For each of these protocols, you can perform every activity available on the official platform all on the DeFi Saver interface. In addition, DeFi Saver also adds more features to enable users to utilize these services even better. Some of these features include automation features that make it easier for users to manage their positions. </p> <p dir="ltr">DeFi Saver utilizes smart contracts to create a connection between the platform and the supported protocols and also between other supported protocols. Apart from creating a one-stop platform for users, DeFi Saver makes it easier to utilize assets across different applications through the Loan Shifter tool that lets users move CDPs (collateralized-debt positions) from one DeFi lending protocol to another. Furthermore, users can create any transaction through drag and drop UI without requiring any coding skills via DeFi Saver's transaction builder called Recipe Creator.</p> <p dir="ltr">DeFi Saver’s supports more than 10 top-tier lending protocols and is known for its liquidation protection features, ranging from automated leverage management to protocol-specific liquidation prevention measures. </p> <h2 dir="ltr">Key Features of DeFi Saver</h2> <p dir="ltr">Now let’s look at some key features of DeFi Saver and how it makes it easy for users to manage their debt position or moving positions between different protocols. </p> <h3 dir="ltr">Leverage Management</h3> <p dir="ltr">Leverage lets users trade more assets than they are currently holding by depositing collateral and leveraging it, which multiplies the amount of assets available for trading by several times. While higher leverage offers higher potential gains, the higher your exposure is to the volatility of the market and the likelihood of possible liquidation.</p> <p dir="ltr">With DeFi Saver, users can easily create a leverage position in a single transaction, where borrowed funds are used to buy more of the collateral asset. When creating a position, users just need to enter their preferred parameters in the Leverage tab and click Create.</p> <p dir="ltr">DeFi Saver also offers Boost and Repay, in which users can handle the actions needed for increasing or decreasing leverage in a single transaction.</p> <div dir="ltr"><img alt="DeFi Saver Gas Efficient" loading="lazy" src="https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/10133/content_DeFi_Saver_Gas_Efficient.webp" style="width: 1200px; height: 563px;"></div> <h3 dir="ltr">Automation</h3> <p dir="ltr">DeFi Saver’s automation feature consists of a series of self-acting algorithms that enable users to manage their loan positions more effectively. Enabling the automation feature allows users to set conditions at which the protocol takes certain actions on their loans automatically. The protocol is developed with smart contracts designed to adjust selected parameters of a user’s loan position. DeFi Saver’s automation protocol is capable of executing immediate and step-wise loan repayment, managing users’ leverage settings, and protecting users from accidental liquidation. </p> <p dir="ltr">However, the protocol only acts based on triggers set by the user. The triggers are the parameter settings and the protocol only swings into action when these trigger conditions are met. </p> <p dir="ltr"><strong>Automated Leverage Management</strong></p> <p dir="ltr">Users can also automate their leverage management by setting automation triggers to keep their positions within a certain health ratio, where preset actions will be automatically performed once certain conditions are met. It also offers loan protection strategies that protect users from liquidation. The liquidation protection automation strategies are available on the lending protocols and according to the project, have protected hundreds of users' positions in large market crashes. Fees are applicable while using any of the automation strategies. According to the project, the fees are charged to the loan position.</p> <div dir="ltr"><img alt="DeFi Saver Boost and Repay" loading="lazy" src="https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/10134/content_DeFi_Saver_Boost_and_Repay.webp" style="width: 1200px; height: 549px;"></div> <p dir="ltr"><strong>Stop Loss and Take Profit</strong></p> <p dir="ltr">For instance, you can use the <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/learn/take-profit-and-stop-loss-levels" target="_blank">stop loss and take profit</a> automation strategy to completely repay your loans as soon as the collateral or borrowed asset reaches a given price point. It also has a ‘trailing stop’ strategy that enables users to set a percentage drop from the peak price of their debt or collateral asset at which their loan repayment will be executed.</p> <h3 dir="ltr">Loan Shifter</h3> <p dir="ltr"><img alt="DeFi Saver Loan Shifter" loading="lazy" src="https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/10135/content_DeFi_Saver_Loan_Shifter.webp" style="width: 1200px; height: 915px;"></p> <p dir="ltr">With DeFi Saver’s <a href="https://app.defisaver.com/shifter?utm_source=CoinGecko&amp;utm_medium=Website+article&amp;utm_campaign=DFS+explainer+article+-+Coingecko" target="_blank">Loan Shifter</a>, users can port their loan position to a different protocol. It allows CDP swaps to a different protocol or selective shifts like collateral and debt swaps. With the CDP swap, users can transfer the whole or part of their loan positions from one protocol supported on the platform to another protocol. On the dashboard, users can preview the changes involved in the shift, which can include service fees, price impacts, and even debt value.</p> <p dir="ltr">Using the collateral swap, users can change assets used as collateral for their loans. The debt swap also allows users to change the borrowed asset or the asset with which they will repay their loans. This can be helpful when trying to lower the borrow rate, as users can switch between the protocols or the debt asset. However, note that the Debt and Collateral swap cannot be executed at the same time.</p> <h3 dir="ltr">Smart Wallet</h3> <p dir="ltr">Smart Wallets are decentralized smart contract-based wallets that enable easier position management on DeFi Saver and ETH Saver, as it keeps positions created using both apps. As a smart contract-based wallet, it lets users execute multiple actions inside a single transaction. With this flexibility, users can easily create and utilize strategies, or create custom ones with DeFi Saver’s Recipe Creator. </p> <p dir="ltr">Smart Wallets also offer an additional layer of safety by providing a layer of separation between your main wallet and the DeFi protocols you use. Instead of granting token approvals to the protocol, these are proxied through the Smart Wallet. </p> <h3 dir="ltr">Smart Savings</h3> <p dir="ltr">Protocols supported on the <a href="https://app.defisaver.com/smart-savings/manage?utm_source=CoinGecko&amp;utm_medium=Website+article&amp;utm_campaign=DFS+explainer+article+-+Coingecko" target="_blank">Smart Savings</a> features include Yearn, Maker, Convex, and B. Protocol, where users can deposit assets into supported pools. To use the Smart Savings option on DeFi Saver, users need to use a Smart Wallet.</p> <p dir="ltr">The smart savings feature on DeFi Saver presents users with a dashboard containing the interest rate data for supported protocols and pools. It gives users an overview of the profitability of different loan pools and assets across different protocols and enables them to move their funds to desired pools in a single click. Users can also estimate earnings made using the Smart Savings feature, although at time of writing there is no interest earned counter implemented. </p> <h3 dir="ltr">Recipe Creator</h3> <p dir="ltr">According to DeFi Saver, the <a href="https://app.defisaver.com/recipes/book?utm_source=CoinGecko&amp;utm_medium=Website+article&amp;utm_campaign=DFS+explainer+article+-+Coingecko" target="_blank">Recipe Creator</a> feature allows users to create their own strategy that the app will bundle up and execute in a single transaction. It is a drag-and-drop system where users can create their own advanced strategy. </p> <p dir="ltr">DeFi Saver also offers users the opportunity to use some <a href="https://help.defisaver.com/features/recipe-creator/pre-made-recipes-recipe-book" target="_blank">pre-made Recipes</a>. Users can search and use them, saving them the time of setting up new recipes. Pre-made recipes are available for Reflexer, Maker, Compound, Aave, Uniswap, Liquity, and Lido Finance. </p> <p dir="ltr">The Recipe Creator feature currently supports Maker, Aave, Compound, and Reflexer actions, as well as Aave v3, Maker, Spark, Morpho Blue, and Balancer flashloans. The project hopes to scale this feature to other protocols in the future.</p> <h3 dir="ltr">Simulation Mode</h3> <p dir="ltr">DeFi Saver offers users a simulation mode to familiarize themselves with the platform in order to reduce the chances of accidental losses due to user errors. DeFi Saver’s simulation mode is a test environment for key operations on the platform. It enables users to try out advanced operations using test tokens before performing them with their real assets.</p> <p dir="ltr">In the simulation mode, users can create a new test account or run the simulations using their existing account. The simulation account is funded initially with 100 test ETH tokens; this can be topped up if needed. However, according to the project, some features are not available in the simulation mode. Unavailable features include; automation for lending positions, Maker CDP history &amp; profit, and Portfolio history.</p> <p dir="ltr">To navigate to the simulation mode, toggle the Simulation Mode switch on the bottom left corner of the application. You can choose any of the account options. Once completed, you can test all basic platform features with the provided test tokens. If you are just testing DeFi Saver, ensure that Simulation Mode is toggled on. </p> <h3 dir="ltr">Exchange: Limit Order and DCA</h3> <p dir="ltr">In addition to lending services, DeFi Saver is also a <a href="https://app.defisaver.com/exchange/swap?utm_source=CoinGecko&amp;utm_medium=Website+article&amp;utm_campaign=DFS+explainer+article+-+Coingecko" target="_blank">DEX meta aggregator</a> as it integrates multiple DEX aggregators like 0x, 1inch, Paraswap, and more. It enables users to run asset swaps through several decentralized exchanges. The Dex aggregator algorithm surfs through supported decentralized exchanges and selects the most viable route for the user’s swap. on DeFi Saver, you can use the direct swap function to perform a one-time swap for your assets.</p> <p dir="ltr">Conversely, you can use any of the advanced features to run your asset exchange operations. Limit orders and <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/learn/what-is-dollar-cost-averaging-dca-in-crypto" target="_blank">DCA (Dollar Cost Averaging)</a> options are available on the exchange platform. Using the limit order feature, you can set the parameters for your swap, including the price level at which you wish your trade to be executed and the amount you wish to purchase at that price. You can also set an expiration date for your order. Once the specified conditions are met before the expiration date, your order will be executed.</p> <p dir="ltr">With the DCA feature, you can set up a conditional and recurring purchase for your orders. Instead of buying or selling all at once, you can use the DCA feature to capture the moving market. You can set a period for your purchase or sell transaction. The DCA transaction will occur after each interval, you can manage your DCA setup from the section below the DCA interface</p> <h2 dir="ltr">Final Thoughts</h2> <p dir="ltr">With different DeFi protocols offering different services, users need to switch between these applications to utilize the services they offer and their unique advantages. But regularly switching between several protocols can be troublesome while potentially increasing the risk levels as users are continually connecting their wallets and signing transactions. </p> <p dir="ltr">With DeFi Saver, a multi-utility application, users can access a host of DeFi protocols on one platform. With complementary applications on the same platform, users can leverage each application’s key advantages without needing to move their assets around or switch between several platforms to complete a more complex transaction. </p> <p dir="ltr">Having said this, it is important to understand how the application works and what it means for you as a user. New users can use the simulation mode to familiarize themselves with the platform and how it works. Always do your own research on any protocol you interact with. This article is only intended for informational purposes and should not be taken as financial advice.</p> <hr> <h2 dir="ltr">What Protocols Are Supported on DeFi Saver?</h2> <p dir="ltr">Some protocols supported by DeFi Saver include:</p> <h3 dir="ltr">MakerDAO</h3> <div dir="ltr"><img alt="MakerDAO DeFi Saver" loading="lazy" src="https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/10136/content_MakerDAO_DeFi_Saver.webp" style="width: 1200px; height: 588px;"></div> <p dir="ltr">On DeFi Saver, users can access <a href="https://app.defisaver.com/makerdao?utm_source=CoinGecko&amp;utm_medium=Website+article&amp;utm_campaign=DFS+explainer+article+-+Coingecko" target="_blank">MakerDAO’s</a> lending and stablecoin generation services. You can create your CDP (Collateralized Debt Position), a key feature of the DAI stablecoin. Creating a CDP enables users to mint DAI with respect to the value of their deposit to the CDP. DAI loans must be below the amount of <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/learn/crypto-collateral-defi" target="_blank">collateral</a> deposited in the CDP. </p> <p dir="ltr">DeFi Saver enables users to use a leveraged position for their DAI loans. With the leverage options, the protocol will use the minted DAI to buy more of the collateral and add to the CDP. That is, if you use the leverage option, no DAI will be received, but more of the asset used as your collateral will be purchased and added to your debt position.</p> <h3 dir="ltr">Compound Finance</h3> <div dir="ltr"><img alt="Compound DeFi Saver" loading="lazy" src="https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/10137/content_Compound_DeFi_Saver.webp" style="width: 1200px; height: 578px;"></div> <p dir="ltr"><a href="https://app.defisaver.com/compound?utm_source=CoinGecko&amp;utm_medium=Website+article&amp;utm_campaign=DFS+explainer+article+-+Coingecko" target="_blank">Compound Finance’s</a> loan facility is available on Defi Saver. Here, users can supply assets to the loan pool, borrow stablecoins (USDC), and repay their loans. Leveraged loan positions are also available via the Boost feature. This allows users to deposit their loans to increase their credit limit. Every service obtainable on the Compound Finance interface is available on the DeFi Saver application. </p> <p dir="ltr">Users can also utilize DeFi Saver’s smart wallet feature on Compound. Migrating to the smart wallet enables users to manage their positions using advanced applications like automation and loan shifting. Users can also withdraw COMP tokens earned on their positions from the Compound Finance interface on DeFi Saver.</p> <h3 dir="ltr">Aave</h3> <div dir="ltr"><img alt="Aave DeFi Saver" loading="lazy" src="https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/10138/content_Aave_DeFi_Saver.webp" style="width: 1200px; height: 589px;"></div> <p dir="ltr"><a href="https://app.defisaver.com/aave?utm_source=CoinGecko&amp;utm_medium=Website+article&amp;utm_campaign=DFS+explainer+article+-+Coingecko" target="_blank">Aave</a> is a multi-chain lending protocol. You can access a majority of the services available on Aave on DeFi Saver. The staking service allows users to stake their Aave and claim staking rewards from the DeFi Saver interface. On Aave’s section on the platform, you can supply assets to the lending pool, borrow and repay loans, and also use the leverage service without visiting Aave. The lending service can be augmented with DeFi Saver’s smart wallet feature, which allows users to apply advanced loan management strategies like loan shifting and automation.</p> <h3 dir="ltr">Spark</h3> <div dir="ltr"><img alt="Spark DeFi Saver" loading="lazy" src="https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/10139/content_Spark_DeFi_Saver.webp" style="width: 1200px; height: 587px;"></div> <p dir="ltr"><a href="https://app.defisaver.com/spark/?utm_source=CoinGecko&amp;utm_medium=Website+article&amp;utm_campaign=DFS+explainer+article+-+Coingecko" target="_blank">Spark</a> is a lending protocol powered by MakerDAO that enables borrowers to do more with assets borrowed against their supplies to the pool. DeFi Saver offers most services available on the Spark platform, including the different asset management modes. On DeFi Saver you can supply assets supported by Spark (including liquid staked ETH and stablecoins like DAI and USDC), borrow against your supplied assets, and use your loans in diverse ways. The Efficiency mode (eMode) is available on the DeFi Saver interface and allows borrowers to extract the highest borrowing power out of their collateral when supplied and borrowed assets are correlated in price. The Claim function allows ETH suppliers on DeFi Saver to claim their share of the wstETH incentive.</p> <h3 dir="ltr">Reflexer</h3> <div dir="ltr"><img alt="Reflexer DeFi Saver" loading="lazy" src="https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/10141/content_Reflexer_DeFi_Saver.webp" style="width: 1200px; height: 586px;"></div> <p dir="ltr"><a href="https://app.defisaver.com/reflexer/manage?utm_source=CoinGecko&amp;utm_medium=Website+article&amp;utm_campaign=DFS+explainer+article+-+Coingecko" target="_blank">Reflexer</a> protocol is an overcollateralized loan protocol where users can supply ETH and mint RAI, a non-pegged stablecoin backed by Ethereum.

<title>What Is Polkadot 2.0 and DOT?</title>
<content type="html"><h2 dir="ltr">What Is Polkadot 2.0?</h2> <p dir="ltr">Polkadot 2.0 will be focused on applications, with Agile Coretime introducing a more flexible system for allocating blockspace, where developers can purchase blockspace based on their needs. This enables the system to better manage its computational resources based on actual demand, optimizing efficiency.</p> <hr> <h3 dir="ltr">Key Takeaways</h3> <ul> <li aria-level="1" dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Polkadot is a Layer 0 solution that enables its parachains and applications to enjoy interoperability across the Polkadot network while inheriting the security of Polkadot. </p> </li> <li aria-level="1" dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr" role="presentation">DOT is the native token of the Polkadot network and serves different purposes including maintaining the security and governance of the network.</p> </li> <li aria-level="1" dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Polkadot 2.0 will introduce key changes to the Polkadot network. This is part of an ongoing effort to create a flexible network, lowering barriers for projects and creating more value for users of the network and DOT.</p> </li> <li aria-level="1" dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr" role="presentation">A key aspect of the 2.0 upgrade is the modification of the slot auction method to a coretime-based method that allows parachains to access blockspace based on their needs.</p> </li> </ul> <hr> <div dir="ltr"><img alt="What is Polkadot 2.0" src="https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/10131/content_What_is_Polkadot_2.0.webp" style="width: 1200px; height: 600px;"></div> <p dir="ltr">Polkadot is one of the top 20 cryptocurrencies by market cap, with investment firms like Grayscale featuring the crypto asset in select funds including the <a href="https://www.grayscale.com/private-funds/gdif" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">GDIF (Grayscale Dynamic Income Fund)</a>. </p> <p dir="ltr">In terms of network adoption, the project reports that <a href="https://polkadot.network/blog/a-year-in-parachains-part-3" target="_blank">over 80 para chains have joined the Polkadot network.</a> About 39 parachains operate on the main network while Kusama, its canary network, hosts over 43 parachains. <a href="https://app.artemis.xyz/chains?tab=chains" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Artemis</a> reports an average of 10,000 active addresses on the network daily, with average daily transactions exceeding 45,000.</p> <h2 dir="ltr">Introduction to Polkadot and How It Works</h2> <p dir="ltr">Polkadot is a Layer 0 solution built from the ground up to tackle blockchain interoperability, offering developers a platform to build applications and chains. Polkadot’s architecture consists of a main Relay Chain – which handles the network’s security, consensus, and interoperability – and multiple parachains, which are application-specific Layer 1 blockchains (parachains) that can have their own tokens. </p> <p dir="ltr">Parachains don’t need to develop their own consensus mechanism for security, as Polkadot’s Nominated-Proof-of-Stake (NPoS) along with its consensus mechanism will secure these parachains. In addition, any Layer 1 chain attached to Polkadot will also enjoy Polkadot’s native interoperability and share information and resources with other parachains. </p> <p dir="ltr">Originally, Polkadot leased Polkadot parachain slots, which provides the winner with access to a “freighter of blocks” regardless of whether they need it. This potentially leads to a waste of energy and resources while creating high entry barriers, which brings us to Polkadot 2.0. </p> <h2 dir="ltr">Polkadot 2.0 and Agile Coretime</h2> <p dir="ltr">Polkadot’s future development is focusing on blockspace redistribution, shifting from a chain-focused ecosystem where each parachain owns an execution core at all times, to an application-focused ecosystem that treats all cores as resources to be used as needed by all applications. By focusing on applications, Polkadot 2.0 will also let projects leverage the collaborative potential across parachains to create inter-chain solutions. </p> <p dir="ltr">This new system will allow applications to reserve and purchase blockspace based on their needs, potentially increasing the platform’s attractiveness to potential builders on Polkadot. The coretime marketplace turns blockspace into a commodity that can be easily leveraged by applications based on their needs, where owners can split or trade coretime. </p> <div dir="ltr"><img alt="Polkadot 2.0 coretime marketplace model" loading="lazy" src="https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/10125/content_Polkadot_2.0_coretime_marketplace_model.webp" style="width: 1200px; height: 500px;"></div> <p dir="ltr">The coretime marketplace model is expected to lower the barriers to entry for developers, while also allowing for more flexible allocation of coretime based on an application’s needs. This will improve the efficiency of blocks on Polkadot, where blocks are produced when needed with the goal of achieving full block capacity, instead of producing empty blocks in times of light traffic. </p> <p dir="ltr">Moving to a coretime marketplace model instead of fixed lease also potentially increases the liquidity and reduces the lockup periods for DOT tokens. It will also contribute funds to the Polkadot treasury as coretime purchase fees are sent to the treasury managed by the Polkadot DAO. Polkadot is also introducing a system of burning a portion of these fees to reduce inflation, where burning is a deflationary measure to balance the circulating supply of the token.</p> <h2 dir="ltr">What Is DOT?  </h2> <p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/polkadot" target="_blank">DOT</a> is the native token of Polkadot. At time of writing, it confers Polkadot <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/learn/governance-tokens" target="_blank">governance</a> rights on its users, and can also be used for staking and bonding to add new parachains to the Polkadot network. Moving forward, it will also be used for coretime purchases.</p> <h3 dir="ltr">Staking</h3> <p dir="ltr">Polkadot is a Proof-of-Stake (POS) blockchain; the relay chain uses the Nominated POS (NPOS) to select validators from the validator pool to verify transaction data. To strengthen the network’s security, validators are required to lock up a specified minimum amount of DOT tokens in their node. A validator’s probability of being selected to validate a block is influenced by the number of DOT tokens locked up in their node. This way, validators are committed to the network. The algorithm applies penalties to defaulting validators, such as token slashing which leads to depletion in the validators’ locked asset. </p> <p dir="ltr">Validators are also rewarded for their role in protecting the network using the DOT token. For every block mined by a validator, they are rewarded with DOT from the undistributed supply. Apart from validators, other DOT holders are also invited to contribute to the network’s security through nominator staking programs. This strengthens the network further as more assets are committed to the consensus layer.</p> <p dir="ltr">Polkadot makes it easy for anyone to stake DOT natively with as little as 1 DOT. By staking DOT natively, anyone can participate in governance while maintaining full control over their assets. At time of writing, the average reward rate on Polkadot is 15.33% (after validator commission). </p> <h3 dir="ltr">Governance</h3> <p dir="ltr">The <a href="https://polkadot.network/features/opengov/" target="_blank">Polkadot OpenGov</a> is the government structure of the Polkadot project. It guides the operations of the Polkadot DAO – a decentralized governance system owned by every DOT holder. Each holder has a stake in the project government relative to the number of DOT tokens they hold. Administrative and technological improvements to the project are first passed to the community where it is voted on by members of the <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/learn/daos-community-organizers-of-web3" target="_blank">DAO</a>. Holders are invited to engage in proposal discussions and vote on the governance portal using their tokens. The Polkadot DAO votes on technical issues like network upgrades, and financial procedures including the management of the treasury funds. </p> <h3 dir="ltr">Auctions</h3> <p dir="ltr">Currently, new parachains are added by bonding tokens through auctions, where DOT tokens are used in bidding for a parachain slot. By bonding your DOT tokens, you are locking them up with the network in exchange for some benefit. Even with the termination of the parachain slot auction model in Polkadot 2.0, the network retains the bonding structure for the staking programs. Tokens staked to the consensus system are also bonded to the network. </p> <h3 dir="ltr">Core Time Purchase (Coming Soon)</h3> <p dir="ltr">As mentioned earlier, the Polkadot 2.0 upgrade will turn blockspace on Polkadot into a commodity that can be purchased and traded by applications on-demand. Instead of sourcing large amounts of DOT tokens to bid for a parachain slot, applications can purchase coretime using DOT tokens. Parachains can reserve bulk core time or purchase just as much core time as needed for the network’s operation at a given time (on-demand). </p> <p dir="ltr">According to the project, this is a more agile model and lowers the participation barriers for projects. It also creates an additional revenue structure for the project. Pending the DAO decision, revenues from core time sales can be burnt, used to fund the treasury, or used in a combination of these cases.</p> <h2 dir="ltr">DOT Morphing: Software Not Security?</h2> <p dir="ltr">Many crypto projects are hanging in limo as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) defines the framework for commodities and other financial instruments. Currently, based on the SEC’s framework, nearly every digital asset offered and sold for fundraising was likely to constitute a security upon launch. However, such digital assets can be re-evaluated at a later date.</p> <p dir="ltr">However, the Web3 Foundation is in active communication with SEC on the status of DOT as a security. According to the Foundation, DOT is not a security because</p> <blockquote> <p dir="ltr">“DOT is used for the purposes for which it was designed – among other things, to bid for and secure parachains and facilitate on-chain governance. Control of the Polkadot network has long been in the hands of DOT holders. Today, DOT is not a security. It is software”</p> </blockquote> <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: right;">- Daniel Schoenberger, Chief Legal Officer at Web3 Foundation</p> <p dir="ltr">To this effect, the Foundation argues that possession of the asset is not necessarily profit-motivated. The morphing process is the re-categorization of an asset from a potential security into software. In a <a href="https://polkadot.network/newsroom/press-releases/web3-foundation-announces-polkadot-blockchains-native-token-dot-has-morphed-and-is-software-not-a-security" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">statement released in November 2022 by the Web3 foundation</a>, the Polkadot has ‘morphed’ and is no longer a security. According to the protocol, Polkadot is software built for engineers and is not an investment mechanism for retail, nor created to be a sort of alternative currency or method of payment.</p> <p dir="ltr">Note that this process is still ongoing at the time of writing and the SEC has not officially declared DOT not a security.</p> <h2 dir="ltr">Final Thoughts</h2> <p dir="ltr">While the slot auctioning model has served the Polkadot network to date, it is rigid as parachains are limited to the core time they are able to reserve in the initial auction. This creates a resource imbalance as some parachains are left with more than enough resources while others scramble for network resources. </p> <p dir="ltr">With Polkadot 2.0 and Agile Coretime, turning blockspace into an on-demand and commoditized resource could be an ingredient for a more flexible network capable of scaling infinitely. Pending the stable launch, it will be interesting to see how the network benefits from these changes. As users of the network and community members of the project, it is important to understand the provisions of the upgrade and what it could mean for you. This article covers some key aspects of the upgrade and is only meant to educate readers. It is not financial advice. Always do your own research.</p> </content>

The community's demand inspired Trociński to work on a new token — DEGEN. However, before we do into the details of the DEGEN token, let's look at the Degen Chain first.</p> <h2 dir="ltr">How Degen Chain Works: Major Components</h2> <p dir="ltr"><img alt="Layers on Ethereum" loading="lazy" src="https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/10035/content_Degen_Chain.webp" style="width: 1200px; height: 675px;"></p> <p dir="ltr">Degen Chain consists of three main components:</p> <h3 dir="ltr">Arbitrum Orbit</h3> <p dir="ltr"><a href="https://arbitrum.io/orbit" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Arbitrum Orbit</a> is a permissionless path developed using Arbitrum technology to launch customizable L2 or L3 chains. Here, the Orbit Chains are Layer 2/3 chains that settle on the Ethereum Layer 1 blockchain.  </p> <div dir="ltr"><span style="font-size:11px;"><img alt="Arbitrum Orbit and L2s/3s" loading="lazy" src="https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/10036/content_Screenshot_2024-04-25_at_9.24.29%E2%80%AFPM.webp" style="width: 1200px; height: 363px;"></span></div> <div dir="ltr"><span style="font-size:11px;">Source: <a href="https://docs.arbitrum.io/launch-orbit-chain/orbit-gentle-introduction" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">docs.arbitrum.io</a></span></div> <p dir="ltr">Degen Chain created tailored products based on the required needs of the DEGEN community. Moreover, running dApps on Orbit Chains enhance performance without compromising security as its security is derived from the main chain (Ethereum). </p> <h3 dir="ltr">AnyTrust</h3> <p dir="ltr"><a href="https://arbitrum.io/anytrust" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">AnyTrust</a> is a protocol developed by Arbitrum Nitro technology to lower the costs around <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/learn/data-availability-blockchain-crypto" target="_blank">data availability</a>, which ensures that all participants have access to transaction data needed to verify blocks. To do so, AnyTrust is operated with the help of a committee of nodes based on trust assumption.</p> <p dir="ltr">The transactions are more efficient as AnyTrust manages the data off-chain to reduce the load on the Layer 1 network. For this reason, Degen Chain can offer lower fees for its users. </p> <h3 dir="ltr">Base</h3> <p dir="ltr">Powered by Coinbase, <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/learn/base-coinbase-layer-2" target="_blank">Base</a> is used by Degen Chain as a settlement layer to facilitate secure and efficient transactions. Base also ensures that its features are provided without compromising the integrity of the Degen Chain network.</p> <p dir="ltr">Furthermore, Base offers <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/learn/ethereum-virtual-machine-evm" target="_blank">full EVM compatibility</a> to Degen Chain for a fraction of the cost. Moreover, developers get access to Coinbase's tools and APIs to build or modify their products based on the community's needs. </p> <h2 dir="ltr">Degen Chain Ecosystem</h2> <p dir="ltr">Degen Chain is expanding due to its community-centric approach and the implementation of Layer 3 blockchain. As a result, the Degen Chain ecosystem stretches across different areas, such as DeFi, GambleFi, and NFTs.</p> <p dir="ltr">Some of the examples of the Degen Chain ecosystem are as follows:</p> <ol> <li aria-level="1" dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>DegenSwap:</strong> <a href="https://dex.swapdegen.tips/#/swap" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">DegenSwap</a>, built on the Degen Chain, allows you to swap and stake tokens. In addition, you can add liquidity to the platform and earn fees in the form of pool tokens. </p> </li> <li aria-level="1" dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>FrogSwap:</strong> Built on top of the Degen Chain, <a href="https://frogswap.xyz/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">FrogSwap</a> facilitates users to stake, farm, and swap tokens. Moreover, FrogSwap Launchpad lists newly issued Degen Chain tokens for sale.</p> </li> <li aria-level="1" dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>DINU (DINU):</strong> <a href="https://www.dinu.tips/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">DINU</a> is a meme coin founded by the developer of DegenSwap with a maximum supply of one billion tokens.</p> </li> <li aria-level="1" dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>NFTdegen.lol:</strong> Claimed to be the first NFT launchpad on the Degen Chain, <a href="https://nftdegen.lol/nft" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">NFTdegen.lol</a> has an inbuilt NFT pool, where users can sell NFTs to the pool at any point in time. </p> </li> <li aria-level="1" dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>Degen Cet (CET): </strong><a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/degen-cet" target="_blank">Degen Cet (CET)</a> is a cat-themed meme coin built on Degen Chain, which is in the process of expanding its community base. </p> </li> </ol> <h2 dir="ltr">Degen Chain Liquidity Mining </h2> <p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.degen.tips/liquidity-mining/season2" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Liquidity mining</a> allows users to earn points to provide liquidity to the DEGEN pool. You can contribute to this pool by visiting <a href="https://app.uniswap.org/add/ETH/0x4ed4E862860beD51a9570b96d89aF5E1B0Efefed/3000?chain=base" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Uniswap v3</a>, which features DEGEN/WETH token pairs with a 0.3% fee tier.</p> <p dir="ltr">Users don't need to lock LP NFTs to participate in the liquid mining, and the reward points earned will vary based on the amount of liquidity provided to the pool.</p> <p dir="ltr">In addition to Uniswap v3, Degen has also established a liquidity pool with the <a href="https://aerodrome.finance/connect?token0=0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000006&amp;token1=0x4ed4e862860bed51a9570b96d89af5e1b0efefed&amp;stable=false" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Aerodrome</a> platform. However, this platform offers independent incentives rather than liquidity mining points. You can choose any of these platforms to contribute to the liquidity and earn incentives or points. </p> <h2 dir="ltr">Degen Chain Bridges</h2> <p dir="ltr">Degen Chain <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/learn/crypto-bridges-blockchain-interoperability" target="_blank">bridges</a> consists of two types, <strong>Bridge</strong> and <strong>Relay Bridge</strong>: </p> <h3 dir="ltr">Bridge </h3> <p dir="ltr">Degen Bridge facilitates the bridging of tokens to the native DEGEN using the Degen Chain. You can bridge your tokens to DEGEN token by following these simple steps:</p> <ul> <li aria-level="1" dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>Step 1:</strong> Visit the <a href="https://bridge.degen.tips/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Degen Bridge platform</a>. </p> </li> <li aria-level="1" dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>Step 2:</strong> Select the network of your token.</p> </li> <li aria-level="1" dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>Step 3:</strong> Select your token in the “From” section</p> </li> <li aria-level="1" dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>Step 4:</strong> Choose the DEGEN token in the “To” section. </p> </li> <li aria-level="1" dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>Step 5:</strong> Connect your wallet with the platform.</p> </li> <li aria-level="1" dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>Step 6:</strong> Complete the bridging process by paying the gas fee.</p> </li> </ul> <h3 dir="ltr">Relay Bridge</h3> <p dir="ltr"><a href="https://relay.link/bridge/degen/?fromChainId=8453&amp;currency=degen" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Relay Bridge</a> claims to be the cheapest and fastest way to transact and bridge across chains. Moreover, this bridge connects users with relayers, who act on the user's behalf across various chains while charging a small fee.</p> <p dir="ltr">In addition, the Relay bridge offers instant bridging through low-latency cross-chain transactions.  </p> <h2 dir="ltr">DEGEN Token and Its Utility</h2> <p dir="ltr">DEGEN is an ERC-20 token created by the founder of Degen Chain, Jacek Trociński. He ended up creating a DEGEN token with tokenomics similar to Uniswap's token, UNI, and Blur's token, BLUR. </p> <p dir="ltr">After launching this token on January 8, 2024, Trociński created a point system to reward the users of the <a href="https://warpcast.com/~/channel/degen" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Degen channel</a>. These reward points were awarded to holders of certain NFTs and to users based on the likes and comments they received on their channel posts.</p> <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"> <p dir="ltr" lang="en"><a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24DEGEN&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">$DEGEN</a> token claims are officially live on <a href="https://t.co/x3IpFkxakT">https://t.co/x3IpFkxakT</a>! After connecting your wallet, you should see a claim button where the countdown timer to launch once was. Thanks to everyone who has made this possible; really appreciate all you degens! 🎉🚀</p> — Degen 🎩 (@degentokenbase) <a href="https://twitter.com/degentokenbase/status/1744313301066993972?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 8, 2024</a> </blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> <p dir="ltr">One point was equal to one DEGEN token, which the users received through airdrops. There are projects on Degen that use the DEGEN token as part of their app, such as the prediction game Perl that lets users bet with DEGEN.</p> <p dir="ltr">The main use cases for DEGEN consist of the following:</p> <ol> <li aria-level="1" dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>Native Gas Token:</strong> To make DEGEN the native gas token was one of the main objectives of Degen Chain's founder, Trociński. As a result, the projects built on the Degen Chain can now use DEGEN to pay for the gas fees.  </p> </li> <li aria-level="1" dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>Token Trading and Swapping:</strong> The DEGEN token is a tradable crypto token that is available on Uniswap v3, Gate.io, Bybit, and more. Moreover, users can easily swap DEGEN with other crypto tokens supported by the exchanges. </p> </li> <li aria-level="1" dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>Gas and Fee Reimbursement:</strong> DegenSwap, a multi-chain and cross-chain aggregator platform, provides 100% gas and swap fee reimbursement to DEGEN token users. To avail of these reimbursed tokens, users must stake the same amount of DEGEN tokens for one year.</p> </li> <li aria-level="1" dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>Grants:</strong> Degen Chain provides <a href="https://www.degen.tips/grants" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">grants</a> to projects and developers that enhance its community by creating Degen-powered apps. For example, <a href="https://drakula.app/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Drakula</a>, a short video social application that functions with DEGEN as its primary token, received 20 million DEGEN tokens as grants.</p> </li> </ol> <h3 dir="ltr">Tokenomics of DEGEN</h3> <p dir="ltr">The Degen Chain project has created approximately 36.97 billion DEGEN tokens at the time of launch. At present, the circulating supply of these tokens is over 12 billion.</p> <p dir="ltr">According to the tokenomics, out of the total DEGEN tokens, 70% is dedicated to the community. Here, 60% of tokens are distributed through three phases of airdrops, with the remaining 10% distributed through liquidity mining.</p> <div dir="ltr"><span style="font-size:11px;"><img alt="DEGEN tokenomics" loading="lazy" src="https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/10038/content_Screenshot_2024-04-25_at_9.27.56%E2%80%AFPM.webp" style="width: 1200px; height: 466px;"></span></div> <div dir="ltr"><span style="font-size:11px;">Source: <a href="https://www.degen.tips/tokenomics" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Degen.tips</a></span></div> <p dir="ltr">This project provided 15% of the total tokens in Airdrop 1. The 20% token allocation for Airdrop 2 is in the process of being distributed. Finally, Airdrop 3 will supply the remaining 25% of allocations for the community members. </p> <p dir="ltr">The other 15% of tokens are allocated to <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/learn/liquidity-pools-crypto-defi" target="_blank">liquidity pools</a> to provide smooth trading and market stability. The remaining 15% is assigned to the investors, team, and the broader ecosystem. Finally, a 1% annual inflation rate starts from 2028.</p> <h2 dir="ltr">Degen Chain and Airdrops</h2> <p dir="ltr">As mentioned above, according to the DEGEN’s tokenomics, 60% of the total token supply is distributed to the community via airdrops (and another 10% through liquidity mining). Additionally, airdrops are scheduled in three phases, which are communicated to Degen's online community through their official accounts on X and Warpcast.</p> <p dir="ltr">At time of writing, there is no new information available around DEGEN’s third airdrop. </p> <h3 dir="ltr">Airdrop 1</h3> <p dir="ltr">The first airdrop, aka Airdrop 1, was announced by Degen's founder and lead developer, Jacek Trociński, through his official Warpcast handle, Jacek, in December 2023. </p> <div dir="ltr"><span style="font-size:11px;"><img alt="DEGEN announcement" loading="lazy" src="https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/10039/content_Screenshot_2024-04-25_at_9.28.53%E2%80%AFPM.webp" style="width: 1200px; height: 323px;"></span></div> <div dir="ltr"><span style="font-size:11px;">Source: <a href="https://warpcast.com/jacek/0x8eb071f6?ref=zerion.io" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Warpcast</a></span></div> <p dir="ltr">During the announcement of the first DEGEN airdrop, the number of community members in Warpcast's Degen channel was low. At present, this number has grown close to 65,000.</p> <p dir="ltr">Airdrop 1 offered 15% of the total supply of 36.97 billion DEGEN tokens, which was almost 5.5 billion tokens, ready to be airdropped. The followers of the Degen channel received the tokens based on the engagement they received on their posts. </p> <p dir="ltr">At the time of writing, 96.83% of users claimed the DEGEN tokens from the first airdrop, which constitutes 1,481 users in total.</p> <h3 dir="ltr">Airdrop 2</h3> <p dir="ltr">After the successful Airdrop 1, Jacek came up with the second airdrop, Airdrop 2, in February 2024. This airdrop offered daily DEGEN tokens to tip other Farcaster users.</p> <div dir="ltr"><span style="font-size:11px;"><img alt="DEGEN airdrop 2" loading="lazy" src="https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/10040/content_Screenshot_2024-04-25_at_9.30.39%E2%80%AFPM.webp" style="width: 1200px; height: 555px;"></span></div> <div dir="ltr"><span style="font-size:11px;">Source: <a href="https://warpcast.com/jacek/0xeb338cba" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Warpcast</a></span></div> <p dir="ltr">After Jacek's post, community members flooded the post, and spammers were also involved. To solve the issue, Jacek introduced an update allowing users with <a href="https://warpcast.com/jacek/0x8f235333?ref=zerion.io" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">10,000+ DEGEN</a> tokens in their wallets to receive tip allowances. Airdrop 2 has supplied 3.95% of its total available 20% DEGEN token supply.</p> <h2 dir="ltr">Degen Bounties Explained</h2> <p dir="ltr">Degen Chain previously offered three types of bounties to its community. We’ll explore these previous bounties:</p> <ol> <li aria-level="1" dir="ltr"> <h3 dir="ltr" role="presentation">Memes Bounty</h3> </li> </ol> <p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.degen.tips/memes-bounty" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Memes Bounty</a> was involved in creating a Degen meme on the Farcaster platform and posting its original cast on the <a href="https://warpcast.com/~/channel/degen" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">official Degen Channel</a> on Warpcast with the hashtag #DegenMeme. </p> <p dir="ltr">The winners were selected based on the number of upvotes for the memes. The most upvoted person won 100K DEGEN, and four runner-ups won 25K DEGEN each. </p> <ol start="2"> <li aria-level="1" dir="ltr"> <h3 dir="ltr" role="presentation">Frames Bounty</h3> </li> </ol> <p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.degen.tips/frames-bounty" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Frames Bounty</a>  assigned participants to create a Degen frame on the Farcaster platform. Selected judges, along with community votes, selected the finalists.</p> <p dir="ltr">The winner received 1.5 million DEGEN and 600M FRAME tokens, and the two runners-up received 500K DEGEN and 400M FRAME tokens each.</p> <ol start="3"> <li aria-level="1" dir="ltr"> <h3 dir="ltr" role="presentation">Logo Bounty</h3> </li> </ol> <p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.degen.tips/logo-bounty" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Logo Bounty</a> asked the Degen Chain community to design a new logo for the DEGEN token. The organizers instructed participants to submit their logos on the Farcaster platform.</p> <p dir="ltr">Each user was limited to submitting only one logo for the bounty. The winner received 5 million DEGEN tokens, and four runner-ups won 1 million DEGEN tokens.</p> <h2 dir="ltr">Conclusion</h2> <p dir="ltr">The community around the Degen Chain witnessed massive growth after its launch. In addition, new projects have started to develop around its ecosystem, with DEGEN as its native token.</p> <p dir="ltr">The Degen Chain's community-focused approach played a crucial role in the wider acceptance of this Layer 3 blockchain.</p> <p dir="ltr">Yet, the question remains: is Degen Chain a cautionary tale about the dangers of unchecked speculation, or a stepping stone towards more meaningful decentralized applications made possible by L3 technology? Perhaps it's both.</p> <p dir="ltr"><em><a href="https://www.coingecko.com/learn/category/coins-and-tokens" target="_blank">Learn about more coins and tokens on CoinGecko.</a></em></p> </content>

<title>Guide on Earning deBridge Points and Improving Airdrop Eligibility</title>
<content type="html"><h2 dir="ltr">How to Earn deBridge Points</h2> <p dir="ltr">Users can earn deBridge points by bridging assets and taking note of the DLN fees, referring others, and by interacting with deBridge's integration partners. </p> <hr> <h3 dir="ltr">Key Takeaways</h3> <ul> <li aria-level="1" dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr" role="presentation">The deBridge protocol is a cross-chain messaging protocol that connects various blockchains and transfers both simple messages and complex data structures. </p> </li> <li aria-level="1" dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr" role="presentation">In 2021, deBridge successfully raised $5.5 million in a funding round led by ParaFi Capital, with participation from Animoca Brands, GSR, Crypto.com, and IOSG Ventures.</p> </li> <li aria-level="1" dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr" role="presentation">With the launch of the deBridge Points program, users can interact with the deBridge protocol to earn points for a future token airdrop.</p> </li> </ul> <hr> <div dir="ltr"><img alt="Earn deBridge points deBridge potential airdrop" src="https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/10074/content_deBridge_airdrop.webp" style="width: 1200px; height: 600px;"></div> <p dir="ltr">deBridge is a high-performance and secure interoperability layer for Web3 that executes decentralized transfers of arbitrary messages and value between blockchains. Essentially, it acts as a cross-chain messaging protocol and allows users and developers to transfer both simple messages and complex data structures across different blockchains. This provides developers with plenty of opportunities to build complex cross-chain solutions such as multi-chain applications, cross-chain lending, automated cross-chain arbitraging services, and NFT bridges.</p> <p dir="ltr">The validation of cross-chain transactions is performed by a network of independent validators who are elected by and work for deBridge governance. Validators maintain the blockchain infrastructure by running a deBridge node to sign all transactions that pass through deBridge smart contracts in different blockchains.</p> <p dir="ltr">deBridge’s architecture is made up of two main layers – the Protocol Layer and the Infrastructure Layer – which work in tandem to ensure secure and efficient cross-chain transfers. The Protocol Layer is a set of smart contracts deployed in every blockchain deBridge supports and is responsible for asset management, fees, and validators through deBridge governance. On the other hand, the Infrastructure Layer is off-chain and a set of validators who operate a deBridge node alongside full nodes are responsible for off-chain validation of cross-chain transactions.</p> <p dir="ltr">Having this two layer architecture achieves several purposes including decentralization that enhances security and trust, scalability for unlimited throughput and high-performance cross-chain transactions, as well as verifiable and open transactions whereby details of any transfer through deBridge’s infrastructure is accessible by all users.</p> <p dir="ltr">deBridge supports a wide array of ecosystems such as <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/chains/ethereum" target="_blank">Ethereum</a>, <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/chains/polygon-pos" target="_blank">Polygon</a>, <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/chains/arbitrum-one" target="_blank">Arbitrum</a>, <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/chains/solana" target="_blank">Solana</a>, and <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/chains/optimistic-ethereum" target="_blank">Optimism</a>. On top of that, deBridge is being used by several applications including Synapse, <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/exchanges/perpetual_protocol" target="_blank">Perpetual Protocol</a>, <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/exchanges/1inch-liquidity-protocol" target="_blank">1inch network</a>, <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/exchanges/jupiter" target="_blank">Jupiter</a>, and Neon EVM. </p> <p dir="ltr">deBridge was initially presented as a project at the Spring 2021 Chainlink Virtual Hackathon. deBridge – built by Anastasia Kondaurova, Alex Smirnov, and Yaroslav Artyukh – was crowned as the grand prize winner and received $8,000. Shortly after, deBridge successfully raised $5.5 million in a funding round led by ParaFi Capital, with participation from Animoca Brands, GSR, Crypto.com, IOSG Ventures, and many others. Just 10 months after winning the Chainlink Global Hackathon, deBridge mainnet was launched. </p> <p dir="ltr">On 9 April 2024, deBridge announced the launch of deBridge Points as part of the project’s efforts to recognize the contributions of users. Early supporters will be rewarded retroactively while new users who actively contribute will receive these points moving forward. The points program will let stakeholders, partners, integrators, and users earn deBridge points based on the value and fees they provide to the deBridge ecosystem. The deBridge Points program will conclude at the launch of the deBridge token. Therefore, now is as good a time as any to start earning your deBridge points!</p> <p dir="ltr">Do take note that at the time of writing, the deBridge team has not made any official announcements for when the token airdrop will take place or what the exact qualifying criteria are. Proceeding with the steps below is not guaranteed to result in receiving airdropped tokens. </p> <h2 dir="ltr">Step 1: Get Solflare Wallet (Optional)</h2> <p dir="ltr">Getting a Solflare wallet is an optional step because it is not necessary to participate. However, do take into consideration that deBridge app users that are using a Solflare Wallet will receive a 1.1x multiplier on their points. If you choose to proceed with this step, be sure that you have assets on the Solana chain that can be used to fund this wallet.</p> <p dir="ltr">First, visit <a href="https://solflare.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://solflare.com/</a> and click <strong>Access wallet</strong> in the top right corner.</p> <div dir="ltr"><img alt="Get Solflare wallet" loading="lazy" src="https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/10041/content_1._Solflare_Page.webp" style="width: 1200px; height: 655px;"></div> <p>Then choose to <strong>Create a new Solflare wallet</strong>.</p> <div dir="ltr"><img alt="Create new Solflare wallet" loading="lazy" src="https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/10042/content_1.1_new_wallet.webp" style="width: 1200px; height: 854px;"></div> <p>Write down your recovery phrase somewhere safe and offline such as by pen in a notebook that you can keep securely. If you lose your recovery phrase, you lose access to your wallet.</p> <div dir="ltr"><img alt="Store your Solflare recovery phrase" loading="lazy" src="https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/10043/content_1.2_recovery_phrase.webp" style="width: 1200px; height: 657px;"></div> <p>After writing it down, proceed to the next step where you will confirm your recovery phrase by manually typing it in word by word.</p> <div dir="ltr"><img alt="Confirm Solflare recovery phrase" loading="lazy" src="https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/10044/content_1.3_confirm.webp" style="width: 1200px; height: 638px;"></div> <p>Once done, your Solflare wallet is ready to connect to deBridge.</p> <div dir="ltr"><img alt="Connect Solflare wallet to deBridge" loading="lazy" src="https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/10045/content_1.4_Solflare_wallet.webp" style="width: 1200px; height: 540px;"></div> <div dir="ltr"> </div> <h2 dir="ltr">Step 2: Make Cross-Chain Transfers</h2> <p dir="ltr">Making cross-chain transfers is the primary method for earning deBridge points. Every $1 paid in fees will give you 100 points. The fees that earn you points are not gas fees but instead are DLN fees which go to deBridge.</p> <p dir="ltr">Head to <a href="https://app.debridge.finance/deswap" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://app.debridge.finance/deswap</a> and <strong>Connect Wallet</strong> in the top right corner.</p> <div dir="ltr"><img alt="Connect wallet to deBridge" loading="lazy" src="https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/10046/content_2._debridge.webp" style="width: 1200px; height: 525px;"></div> <p>Choose which wallet you want to connect, such as the Solflare wallet that is available as a web wallet.</p> <p dir="ltr">However, in this example we will be proceeding with MetaMask.</p> <div dir="ltr"><img alt="Connect wallet to deBridge" loading="lazy" src="https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/10047/content_2.1_connect_wallet.webp" style="width: 1200px; height: 741px;"></div> <p>Between the two images below, you can see that the amount of assets you bridge does not impact your points earned. Rather it is the DLN fee you need to pay. </p> <p dir="ltr">When planning your transactions, take into consideration the gas fees on different chains and also how bridging $10 can get you approximately the same number of points as $200.</p> <div dir="ltr"><img alt="Check gas fees and points" loading="lazy" src="https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/10048/content_2.2_bridge.webp" style="width: 1200px; height: 595px;"></div> <div dir="ltr"> </div> <div dir="ltr"><img alt="check gas fees and points 2" loading="lazy" src="https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/10049/content_2.3_consider.webp" style="width: 1200px; height: 594px;"></div> <div dir="ltr"> </div> <h2 dir="ltr">Step 3: Refer Others</h2> <p dir="ltr">You can earn 25% of the points successfully earned by your referrals. For example, if your referral earns 100 points then you get 25 points.</p> <p dir="ltr">In the top right corner, go to <strong>Refer</strong>. On the referral page, you can also see your points rank, total points, and referral points. </p> <p dir="ltr">You will need to choose a chain to generate your referral link. The referral code is assigned by the smart contract in Polygon and is initialized by other chains on deBridge through cross-chain messaging. </p> <div dir="ltr"><img alt="deBridge referral" loading="lazy" src="https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/10050/content_3._refer.webp" style="width: 1200px; height: 503px;"></div> <p>Hit <strong>Generate</strong> to see the details of how much you will need to pay in fees for the invitation link. In this example, we generated it on Arbitrum and paid 0.001 ETH in fees. Confirm the transaction in your wallet.</p> <div dir="ltr"><img alt="Generate invitation link deBridge" loading="lazy" src="https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/10051/content_3.1_generate_link.webp" style="width: 1200px; height: 705px;"></div> <div dir="ltr"> </div> <div dir="ltr"><img alt="Approve request to generate invitation link from wallet" loading="lazy" src="https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/10052/content_3.2_confirm_in_wallet.webp" style="width: 1200px; height: 678px;"></div> <p>After your link is generated, you can copy it to share with others. You will also see more statistics on your referrals such as total users, trade volume, and referral points accrued.</p> <div dir="ltr"><img alt="Share deBridge invitation link" loading="lazy" src="https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/10053/content_3.3_referral_stats.webp" style="width: 1200px; height: 562px;"></div> <div dir="ltr"> </div> <h2 dir="ltr">Step 4: Interact with Integration Partners (Optional)</h2> <p dir="ltr">Projects that have integrated deBridge’s cross-chain infrastructure will also provide you with deBridge points. Some examples are Jupiter, Solflare Wallet, Perpetual Protocol, and more. </p> <p dir="ltr">We recommend looking at deBridge’s X (previously known as Twitter) account at <a href="https://twitter.com/deBridgeFinance" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://twitter.com/deBridgeFinance</a> to see which projects are utilizing deBridge and providing more opportunities to earn points. You can also browse through <a href="https://debridge.finance/blog/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://debridge.finance/blog/</a> to read up more on the numerous integration partners and decide which others you would want to interact with. </p> <p dir="ltr">Do take into consideration that each project will let you earn points in different ways. For example, with Zeta Markets you would need to create and bridge funds to your Zeta margin account. Meanwhile, you could also create a Backpack wallet to connect with deBridge and bridge your funds in order to earn points.</p> <div dir="ltr"><img alt="deBridge integration partners" loading="lazy" src="https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/10054/content_4._integration_partners.webp" style="width: 1200px; height: 755px;"></div> <h2 dir="ltr">Sidenote</h2> <p dir="ltr">Past loyalty is also being rewarded retroactively, with multipliers for different tiers that are based on a specific time period for wallet interaction. For example, wallets in Tier 1 interacted with deBridge between 17 February 2022 - 15 June 2023 and will receive a 3x multiplier on past activity for this date range as well as 1.5x multiplier on current activities. The table below outlines the different tiers, date range, and multiplier. As shown in step two above, the wallet being used in this example is receiving a 1.1x multiplier on current activities because it interacted with deBridge during the Tier 3 date range.</p> <div dir="ltr"><img alt="deBridge points sidenote" loading="lazy" src="https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/10055/content_sidenote.webp" style="width: 1200px; height: 456px;"></div> <h2 dir="ltr">Conclusion</h2> <p dir="ltr">The deBridge protocol is a bridging solution that connects various blockchains and allows users to bridge assets through cross-chain asset transfers. Having a two layer architecture that utilizes the Protocol Layer and the Infrastructure Layer ensures that decentralization is accessible both on-chain and off-chain. The protocol has recently announced the launch of its deBridge Points program, giving users the opportunity to earn points for a future token airdrop.</p> </content>

<title>API3's "Netflix Moment" and the Changing Oracle Landscape</title>
<content type="html"><div dir="ltr"><img alt="API3 Oracle Landscape" src="https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/10066/content_API3_%281%29.webp" style="width: 1200px; height: 600px;"></div> <p dir="ltr"><em>This article is brought to you by API3.</em></p> <p dir="ltr">Since its launch in 2020, API3 has been positioned as a challenger to Chainlink and has been dubbed the “<a href="https://medium.com/api3/is-api3-the-chainlink-killer-3bd59f93c895" target="_blank">Chainlink killer</a>.” From the beginning, API3 has been on a mission to transform the blockchain <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/learn/crypto-blockchain-oracle" target="_blank">oracle</a> landscape by building solutions around first-principles like data source transparency and the verifiable decentralization of onchain data. Along with developing solutions to bring verifiable, decentralized data onchain directly from the data providers themselves, API3 also introduced a solution to recapture oracle extractable value (OEV) in their <a href="https://medium.com/api3/oracle-extractable-value-oev-13c1b6d53c5b" target="_blank">2022 litepaper</a>, showing how lending protocols such as Aave are leaking millions of dollars a year due to <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/learn/the-beginner-s-guide-to-mev" target="_blank">maximal extractable value (MEV)</a> as a result of oracle architecture. </p> <p dir="ltr">Over the past year, API3 has demonstrated remarkable growth. Last year they launched the API3 Market as a developer-centric marketplace for onchain data. Scaling across 17 blockchain networks and offering over 160 data feeds, API3 has grown to a Total Value Secured (TVS) of over $600M. This significant progress highlights the success of API3’s developer-first strategy and the impact of oracle solutions in the world of onchain finance.  </p> <div dir="ltr"><span style="font-size:11px;"><img alt="DefiLlama API3 chart" loading="lazy" src="https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/10064/content_API3_TVL.webp" style="width: 1200px; height: 454px;"></span></div> <div dir="ltr"><span style="font-size:11px;">Source: <a href="https://defillama.com/oracles/API3" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">DefiLlama</a></span></div> <p dir="ltr">Central to API3's developer-first approach is the upcoming introduction of a Data on Demand marketplace, complemented by a soon to be launched built-in solution to protect all its data feeds against MEV with the OEV Network. With these innovative solutions, API3 is not just challenging the status quo, but setting out to fundamentally redefine the oracle landscape. Just as Netflix rapidly transformed home entertainment in the early 2000’s, this could be the moment when the blockchain oracle landscape changes forever. </p> <h2 dir="ltr">Evolution to Data on Demand</h2> <p dir="ltr">The API3 Market was developed as an open, self-serve marketplace for utilizing decentralized data feeds, or dAPIs. Developers looking to power their protocol with verifiable, decentralized data served directly onchain from first-party oracle nodes can visit the <a href="https://market.api3.org/dapis" target="_blank">API3 Market</a>, where they can seamlessly browse, access, and manage a wide variety of data feeds, including crypto, forex, equities, and commodities.</p> <p dir="ltr">As part of a significant upgrade to the API3 Market, API3 is launching a Data on Demand marketplace for data feeds, mirroring the ease of a web2 experience many developers are used to. This next evolution of the API3 Market automates the purchase and configuration of data feeds with a straightforward Pay-and-Go process. This means that developers on blockchain networks and decentralized applications (dApps) will no longer need to go through an intermediary or speak to a human to begin accessing our wealth of data feeds, simplifying the process of accessing off-chain data for developers.</p> <p dir="ltr">The API3 Market makes it easy for developers requiring oracle services to get the data they need when they need it. Rather than having to manage their own infrastructure, developers can simply read data that is directly maintained onchain. </p> <div dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size:11px;"><img alt="API3 Market: Data on Demand" loading="lazy" src="https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/10067/content_API3_Data_on_Demand.webp" style="width: 1200px; height: 677px;"></span></div> <div dir="ltr"><span style="font-size:11px;">API3 Market: Data on Demand</span></div> <p dir="ltr">Visualize this transition as similar to going from the era of DVD rentals at Blockbuster to the convenience of Netflix’s on-demand streaming service BUT for blockchain developers. </p> <p dir="ltr">API3’s data on demand model not only democratizes access to the data needed to power many DeFi protocols, but also facilitates the rapid scaling and adoption of these data feeds across new chains. With the upgrade of the API3 Market, API3 will be able to commence on its ambitious goal of scaling its oracle stack to over 40 total blockchains this year with a heavy focus on Layer 2s. </p> <p dir="ltr">The capability for scaling horizontally to new chains stems from API3’s EVM-compatible first-party oracle architecture and standardized dAPIs. This design allows API3 to quickly integrate with new networks, thereby eliminating the bottlenecks experienced with third-party oracle models. With the rapid deployment of onchain data to new chains, API3 employs a <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/learn/vertical-scaling" target="_blank">vertical scaling</a> strategy that enhances data accessibility on each network. Designed with a focus on cost-effectiveness, dAPIs allow developers to directly read onchain data without incurring extra fees, lowering the barriers to entry for new projects on the network. </p> <p dir="ltr">The network effects of the API3 Market amplify its utility. As the go-to destination for onchain data, it minimizes the complexity and work traditionally associated with designing a tech stack. API3 enables developers to focus more on what they do best, which is building their applications, without the distraction of running extra unnecessary infrastructure or having to coordinate with intermediaries. </p> <p dir="ltr">Data on demand on the API3 Market is going to transform the developer experience, similar to how Netflix transformed content consumption by making a vast library of content available at a few clicks of a button. </p> <h2 dir="ltr">Improving Lending Protocol Performance With the OEV Network</h2> <p dir="ltr">Along with upgrading the API3 Market to optimize the developer experience, API3 is soon going to be launching their OEV Network to optimize lending protocol efficiency. </p> <p dir="ltr">Oracles are used by blockchain applications for bringing off-chain data, like price feeds, onchain. Most protocols that rely on oracles become targets for value extraction, or MEV, through frontrunning, arbitrage, and liquidations. Lending protocols are now waking up to how much value is leaking out of their ecosystem, with lending protocols losing millions of dollars every year. </p> <p dir="ltr">In the last three years, Aave alone has had over $2 billion in <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/learn/defi-liquidation-crypto" target="_blank">liquidations</a> across all chains, with over $100 million paid out in liquidation incentives. These liquidation bonuses, while necessary to maintain protocol health, result in significant value leaking to searchers and block builders and lead to a negative user experience. </p> <p dir="ltr">The OEV Network will be introduced to recapture this value, creating an efficient market where oracle service providers and searchers come together to mitigate the negative impact of MEV through specialized order-flow auctions. With OEV Network, searchers don’t need to wait for the price to update onchain, they can trigger the price update when it is most valuable. As an application-specific solution, it captures up to 90% of the MEV created at the protocol level due to oracle updates and gives it back to the dApp that generated the value.</p> <div dir="ltr"> <img alt="OEV Network liquidation flowchart" loading="lazy" src="https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/9841/content_OEV_Network_liquidation_flowchart.webp" style="width: 1200px; height: 674px;"> <p dir="ltr">OEV Network gives every lending protocol a built-in MEV solution by improving upon critical inefficiencies in the current oracle design space. By creating an efficient market for oracle updates, it not only improves the efficiency of lending protocols but also allows them to capture a multi-million dollar opportunity. </p> <h2 dir="ltr">Lending Protocols Will Never Be the Same</h2> <p dir="ltr">The OEV Network introduces a simple change in market dynamics that will revolutionize the liquidation game for lending protocols, improving their health and minimizing the negative externalities of bleeding value due to liquidations. The design maintains the security guarantees of the data feed while allowing the value that the oracle update generates to be auctioned off and recaptured.</p> <p dir="ltr">The OEV Network presents an evolution in oracle architecture, enhancing the performance, efficiency, and sustainability of lending protocols. By recapturing up to 90% of the MEV that is currently leaking out of lending protocols, the OEV Network opens the door to innovation, improving the onchain lending experience by creating opportunities for protocols to offer better yields, lower fees, or experiment with new features.</p> <p dir="ltr">Lending protocols will never be the same.</p> <p dir="ltr">Netflix didn’t set out to kill Blockbuster, they were playing two different games. Blockbuster was comfortable as the dominant market force. Netflix was focused on innovation. In the end, one of them was easy to use, easy to work with, gave you what you needed when you needed it, and saved you money. </p> <p dir="ltr">In hindsight, the choice was obvious. </p> </div> </content>
